S
etagainstthebackdropofaloom-
ing new banking crisis stretch-
ing from the US to the EU, there
was a high risk that chancellor Jeremy
Hunt’s ﬁrst proper Budget would be
completely eclipsed, especially with
the deluge of leaks revealing the best
bits beforehand – although he saved
thetotalabolitionofthelifetimeallow-
ance and the scale of the increase in
the annual pension allowance.
Fears in the US over the extent of
unrecognised bond losses, unhedged
exposures and panicking depositors
had receded slightly by mid-week,
allowing the chancellor to briefly
reclaim the limelight. But that’s not
where the banking story ends. It has
heapednewpressureonCreditSuissein
particular, and there are repercussions
for US monetary policy given how falls
in bond values have injected fragility
into parts of the banking system. The
Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) episode will
test, and may curb, the Fed’s appetite
for accelerating its use of interest rates
to cool price rises. We’ll ﬁnd out next
week if there is a change of tack.
Another fallout could be increased
resistance to one particular UK growth
initiative – the theme at the heart
of this week’s Budget. The govern-
ment harbours ambitions to release
locked-upreservesatbanksandinsur-
ers for investing in infrastructure, and
ﬂedgling tech and biotech businesses.
But one reason why SVB has not trig-
geredasecondﬁnancialcrisisisbecause
bankshavebeenforcedtobewellcapi-
talised. Tampering with that now to
achieveothergoalscouldbefoolhardy.
The Budget made it clear, though,
thatplanstochannelinvestmentfrom
deﬁned contribution pension funds
“and other sources” into long-term
assets are going ahead. This, however,
was only one strand in a multi-strand
growth Budget.
Improved economic forecasts (the
OBR has reversed its prediction of
recession, GDP rose by 0.3 per cent in
January, tax receipts have increased
plus the energy subsidy has cost far
less than envisaged) meant the chan-
cellorwasinafarlessdraconianmood
than last November.
Hunt may still have one eye on his
goalofreducingdebt,onpotentialnew
headwindsinanunstableworldandan
election in 2024/25, but the focus was
ﬁrmly on helping businesses. While
there was no backtracking on 25 per
centcorporationtax,therewereseveral
keysupportmeasures.Thenewcapital
allowances plan that allows all invest-
ment in IT, equipment plant and/or
machinery to be deducted in full and
immediatelyfromtaxableproﬁtwillbe
available for the next three years and
theintentionistomakeitpermanent–
although, points out RSM, the election
could get in the way of that.
The OBR reckons this will boost
business investment by around 3 per
cent and cost the exchequer £9bn a
year. This was complemented by
enhanced R&D tax breaks targeted at
smaller life sciences businesses. Both
allowancesareimportantinhelpingto
stem the UK’s drift into decline.
Then there were the measures to
help ﬁll 1mn job vacancies with more
generous childcare subsidies, and
a dramatic loosening of the pension
rules to encourage people to both stay
in the workforce for longer and return
to work if they have left.
Thesurpriseabolitionofthelifetime
allowance, described by James Jones-
Tinsley at Barnett Waddingham, as
“the opposite of a band-aid on a bullet
wound; it is an operation on a graze”,
targeted those thinking of taking
early retirement – speciﬁcally medi-
cal professionals given that at least 34
per cent of all people who exceeded
the annual allowance in 2019/20 were
members of the NHS pension scheme,
according to data from Quilter. It may
not ultimately have much impact on
employment numbers but will bene-
ﬁt many people saving for retirement.
Allthreebigpensionchanges(seepage
11) are a compensation of sorts for the
cutstocapitalgainstaxreliefanddivi-
dend allowance, and higher personal
tax from next month.
So lots of strands, all carefully and
rightly focused on key issues for busi-
nessandindividuals,andgluedtogether
into a foundation of sorts for growth.
Whethertheyhavethepowertopropel
usintoagoldenfutureofstronggrowth
isanothermatter.Thebigchallengeyet
to be addressed is how the chancellor
intendstocounterthedualthreatfrom
theUS’sInﬂationReductionActandthe
EU’s Net Zero Industry Act.
In Hunt’s own words, there is a still
a long way to go.

Credit Suisse under
renewed pressure
A further 25 per cent plunge to
CHF1.70 a share on Wednesday illus-
trates how far the once imposing
Credit Suisse (CH:CSGN) has fallen
since it reached an all-time high of
almost CHF79 a share 16 years ago.
It is true that the banking crisis the
following year, plus a decade-and-a-
half of interest rate suppression, has
posed a recovery challenge every bit
as daunting for the Swiss bank as its
peer institutions, but too many of
its wounds are self-inﬂicted to merit
much more sympathy. That seems
to be a conclusion that the bank’s
biggest shareholder, Saudi National
Bank (SA:1190), which holds 9.9 per
cent of the shares, has also reached
after appearing to rule out more
ﬁnancial support for Credit Suisse –
SNB’s stake acquired in October last
year is currently CHF500mn under
water.
It can’t be understated how diﬃ-
cult the bank’s position is as market
fright over the failures of two US
regional banks cause unease across
the ﬁnancial system. Credit Suisse
must somehow restructure and
decouple its investment arm from its
wealth management business, with-
out causing too much disruption and
at a time when even the merest hint
of problems is enough for shorters to
get stuck in.
It isn’t just the speculators who
seem to be taking bets about the
bank’s future. Credit default swaps for
Credit Suisse currently cost around
18 times those of its near-neighbour
bank, UBS (CH:UBSG) – also an insti-
tution not unfamiliar with problems
and scandals – with its credit default
swap curve showing a steep inversion.
This means the market thinks that,
theoretically, a bank failure is more
likely to happen sooner, rather than
at some point in the future.
In a more general sense, while the
focus on higher interest rates bene-
ﬁting banks was justiﬁably part of
their investment case in 2022, the
less understood ﬂipside is how years
of cheap money have lulled certain
institutions into a false sense of secu-
rity. Credit Suisse is well capitalised
and does not have the interest rate
risks that hurt the collapsed US lend-
ers. But investors jitters stemming
from that episode can still hurt it.

J
eremy Hunt this week unveiled
a restrained Spring Budget,
albeit while telling MPs that “in
the autumn we took difficult deci-
sions to deliver stability and sound
money” meaning that “today, we
deliver the next part of our plan, a
Budget for growth”.
Hunt announced that under-
lying debt in five years’ time is
expected to be nearly three percent-
age points lower as a proportion of
gross domestic product (GDP) than
forecast in the autumn. But despite
a better-than-anticipated public
finance position and the fact that
the UK is now expected to dodge
a recession this year, there were
limited giveaways, with the tax
increases announced in last year’s
Autumn Statement pushing ahead
as planned.
Although the chancellor stressed
the importance of driving growth,
and there is the promise of a green
energy plan to come at the end of
the month, the measures were more
restrained than those in the short-
lived “Growth Plan” announced
in September’s ‘mini’ Budget.
Nevertheless, several of the meas-
ures are expected to impact the UK’s
macroeconomic performance.
Encouraging business investment
Corporation tax will rise as planned
to 25 per cent this April, although
Hunt announced a regime of capi-
tal allowances and other reforms
designed to boost investment.
Under the new measures, busi-
nesses can offset 100 per cent of
investments in IT equipment, plant
or machinery assets against profits,
allowing companies to significantly
reduce their tax bills.
Hunt also pledged to set up
a string of 12 investment zones
across the country. These zones will
be given tax incentives and other
benefits worth £80mn each over
five years.
Pension reforms
Since the start of the pandemic, the
number of inactive workers (who
are neither working nor looking for
work) has increased by 500,000,
with more than half of the increase
in inactivity in workers aged
between 50 and 64.
In an effort to encourage older
workers to re-enter the labour
force, Hunt increased the cap on
tax-free annual pension contribu-
tions to £60,000 from £40,000 and
abolished the lifetime allowance
completely. It was previously set at
£1.07mn.
Other labour market meas-
ures
Hunt also acknowledged the role of
disability and long-term sickness
in high inactivity rates. The chan-
cellor announced measures includ-
ing changes to sickness benefits and
additional funding for back pain
and mental health support designed
to encourage participation.
The chancellor also introduced
measures to help parents, who can
be discouraged from working due
to prohibitive childcare costs. In a
drive to “break down the barriers
to work”, free childcare provision
will be extended to all children aged
one and two.
Support for households
As expected, Hunt has extended
the energy price guarantee (EPG)
for a further three months. The end
of the EPG would otherwise have
seen typical household energy bills
rise from £2,500 to over £3,000 in
Hunt unveils ‘Budget for
growth’ as forecasts improve
The chancellor revealed a fiscal statement with new reliefs aimed at negating corporate tax
rises, while also committing to labour market reforms . Hermione Taylor reports
April. Hunt said that the change
would ease pressure on families,
while helping to lower inflation, too.
The Office for Budget Responsibility
fiscal watchdog now expects infla-
tion to fall back to the 2 per cent
target from 2024, and drop to 2.9
per cent by the end of the year.
The 23 per cent planned rise in
fuel duty was also scrapped for a
year, at an expected total cost to the
Treasury of around £5bn.
An increase in defence funding
over the next five years was also
announced, although an increase
in spending as a percentage of GDP
will only rise from 2 per cent to 2.5
per cent when “fiscal and economic
circumstances allow”.
Economists have long suspected
that Hunt would limit giveaways
this month, preserving scope to
loosen fiscal policy before the next
general election. This must be held
by January 2025, and will most
likely be sometime next year.
The Budget was announced
against a backdrop of indus-
trial action, with school, NHS,
civil service and tube strikes all
scheduled to take place on the
day. No further details on a
public sector pay settlement were
announced, but the chancellor is
said to be debating whether any
pay awards should be in the form
of permanent salary increases or
one-off bonuses. Estimates suggest
that an inflation-matching pay
deal of 5.5 per cent over 2023-24
would add an extra £5bn to the total
pay bill.
After the ructions caused by the
Truss government last September,
this was in many ways a more
normal Budget – despite the fact
that the easing announced for the
next tax year is not far off, in abso-
lute terms, the amount announced
six months ago. Hunt has just
£6.5bn of fiscal ‘headroom’ – a very
small amount in economic terms –
to meet his target of debt as a share
of GDP reducing by 2027/28. In the
context of strikes, market turmoil
and falling real wages, it certainly
doesn’t yet feel like business as
usual.

INCREASE FROM

TO £60,000
A
trio of pension tax changes
announced in chancellor
Jeremy Hunt’s Spring Budget
will enable people to save more for
retirement tax free.
In a move that went beyond
pre-Budget expectations, Hunt
abolished the lifetime allowance
(LTA), which currently caps the
total amount savers can hold in their
pension pots without incurring a tax
charge at £1,073,100. The annual
allowance and money purchase
annual allowance (MPAA), which
set how much people can contribute
to their pension pots tax-free every
year, will increase.
The measures are aimed at keep-
ing older people in the workforce
for longer or bringing them back to
work, as the UK continues to strug-
gle with high levels of economic
inactivity, particularly in the over-
50s cohort.
Lifetime allowance
The lifetime allowance was noto-
riously complicated to understand
and plan for because it applied
to the total value of pension pots
- meaning it could be breached inad-
vertently due to investment growth.
The LTA has been bumped up and
down several times since it was
introduced in 2006 at £1.5mn, and
was due to remain frozen until 2026.
Breaching the LTA resulted in a 55
per cent tax charge if you received
your pension savings as a lump
sum, or a 25 per cent tax charge if
withdrawn any other way. The tax
charge will be removed from April
2023 and the lifetime allowance will
be abolished from April 2024.
The maximum pensions tax-free
lump sum able to be taken by those
without protections will be retained
at its current level of £268,275 and
frozen thereafter.
Dean Butler, managing direc-
tor for customer retail at Standard
Life, said that while the decision
had likely stemmed from the need
to retain doctors who previously
would have retired early to avoid
significant LTA-linked tax bills,
there were good reasons to review
the allowance as it was “increasingly
catching middle and higher earn-
ers, particularly those with defined
benefit pensions, who have done the
right thing and saved regularly over
the years”. Gary Smith, an adviser at
Evelyn Partners, added: “While the
numbers breaching the LTA were
small, that is probably dwarfed
by the numbers who have ceased
to save in to pensions before they
reach the ceiling.”
Annual allowances
People will also be able to contrib-
ute higher amounts to their
pensions tax-free every year, thanks
to increases to the annual allowance
and the money purchase annual
allowance (MPAA).
The annual allowance restricts
Spring Budget: Hunt abolishes
lifetime allowance entirely
The chancellor’s surprise move goes further than expected, and comes alongside
other significant pension changes. Val Cipriani reports
how much savers can contribute to
their pensions every year and will
increase from £40,000 to £60,000.
The change is helpful for those that
are looking to catch up with their
retirement savings later in their
careers, such as business owners.
The minimum tapered annual
allowance is also increasing.
Currently, for every £2 your
adjusted income exceeds £240,000,
your annual allowance for the tax
year reduces by £1, down to a mini-
mum of £4,000. From April this will
now increase to £10,000, and the
income threshold for the tapered
annual allowance will rise from
£240,000 to £260,000.
The MPAA further reduces the
annual amount people can contrib-
ute to their pensions tax free and
is typically triggered when retirees
start to access their pension pots
flexibly. The threshold will rise
from £4,000 to £10,000.
The MPAA disadvantages people
who access their pension savings in
a moment of financial stress and
later want to rebuild their pots, as
well as people who wish to go back
to work after taking some form of
early retirement. An increase to the
allowance had been campaigned for
by a number of industry figures,
with 17 financial organisations sign-
ing a letter to Hunt ahead of the
Budget asking for this very change.
Helen Morrissey, head of pension
analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown,
noted Hunt could have gone further
and reviewed it altogether. “The
MPAA was introduced to stop ‘recy-
cling’, where people access their
pension and then reinvest contri-
butions for another round of tax
relief, but the same thing could be
achieved with anti-recycling rules,
which only kick in when someone
has accessed their pension with the
express intent to recycle the cash,”
she said.
Finally, Hunt has left the state
pension age untouched. There
were rumours that he might bring
forward the date on which it is due
to increase to 68, from 2046 to the
mid 2030s, but this did not mate-
rialise.

A
week after Silicon Valley Bank
(SVB) collapsed, the ripple
eﬀects are still being felt across
theﬁnancialsystem.Whatcomesnext
is unclear, but sector downgrades and
wild market swings show that uncer-
tainty is widespread. BlackRock chief
executive Larry Fink likened it to a
“slow-rolling” crisis that has marked
a sharp full stop on the venture-capi-
tal-backed free-money era.
Depositors at the bank itself are
being protected by a buyout in the
UK, by HSBC (HSBA), and in the US
by the government. This also extends
to tech companies with hundreds of
millions held at the bank.
But beyond the SVB customers
(and those of the two another small
US banks that failed in the following
days), the fright over banks’ balance
sheets has dramatically changed
expectations over the US Federal
Reserve’s next interest rate decision.
A 25 basis point increase was previ-
ously seen as a lock, with that level of
growth set to continue.
As late as last week, markets
expected US interest rates to stay
higher for longer as strong economic
data prompted hawkish comments
from US Federal Reserve chair Jerome
Powell. Before the SVB crisis, markets
were pricing in a peak US interest rate
of 5.75 per cent in September.
Economists at Capital Economics
said this week that the episode “may
limit the extent of further inter-
est rate rises and the length of time
for which rates need to stay at their
peaks”. Market pricing now indicates
that rates will peak around 4.8 per
cent in May, with cuts following by
September.
Tech wobble
This crisis began with the tech
sector acting in concert to pull
holdings from SVB. Now, after
confirmation all depositors will be
made whole, investors are still fear-
ful of the long-term consequences
for the tech sector. SVB was of
central importance in the tech-
nology ecosystem and its sudden
collapse will tighten lending condi-
tions across the sector. Nearly half
of US venture-backed technology
and life science companies and 44
per cent of 2022 venture-backed
IPOs banked with SVB.
There were two key reasons SVB
failed. One was its overexposure to
lossmaking technology start-ups.
Rising interest rates dried up
venture capital funding last year
and this forced SVB’s depositors to
dig into cash reserves: total client
funds swung from an inflow of
around $40bn (£33bn) a quarter in
2021 to an average quarterly outflow
of $14.5bn in 2022. The other was its
massive exposure to US Treasury
bonds – to cover outflows it had to
sell a portion of these for a loss last
week – having previously held them
on a mark-to-maturity basis on its
balance sheet – triggering the need
for a capital raise.
The overall VC trend is worth
digging into, as it has continued into
2023. In its latest quarterly report,
SVB said US quarter-on-quarter VC
investment was “on track to decline
15-20 per cent” and there was also a
further $18.6bn outflow of customer
funds.
This outflow turned to a rush on
Thursday evening after the bank
announced its capital raise. But the
bank’s collapse wasn’t a freak event
in terms of catalysts: issues caused
by rising interest rates and fund-
ing issues for SVB’s cash-burning
clients were emerging throughout
the last year.
SVB collapse:
what comes next?
The collapse of one mid-sized US bank has roiled global markets.
What comes next could be serious for all investors. Alex Hamer and
Arthur Sants report
Plc impacts
Companies listed in the UK that
banked with SVB and its local subsid-
iary were largely quick to update
investors on their positions. Only one
saw any great drama, Aim-traded
company Polarean Imaging (POLX)
suspended its shares for a day after
revealing most of its cash was in
accounts administered by SVB.
Once the US government had
conﬁrmed deposits above $250,000
would be made whole, Polarean
reopened trading. Others had indi-
rect exposure. Molten Ventures
(GROW), which holds unlisted tech
ﬁrms, saw its share price fall 11 per
cent in the ﬁve days to Wednesday.
“Molten has worked closely with
its portfolio companies to further
improve [counterparty risk position-
ing] over recent days,” the company
said, adding it did not foresee “any
meaningful liquidity impact”.
Aside from revealing unusual
concentrations on cash, the macro-
economic impacts are likely to
outweigh plcs’ direct exposure to
SVB in terms of risks to UK investors.
The banks
Up to the time of publication, the
major banks had seen a sell-off,
rebound, and then further sell-oﬀ
as investors grappled with the SVB
drama. The European banks – with
stricter balance sheet rules and oper-
ating in a completely diﬀerent set of
markets – may have copped more
than their fair share of the selling
here (see page 62 for more on this
sector).
Main street specialist Wells Fargo
(US:WFC) has traded down 9 per
cent since the SVB collapse. But Fink
at BlackRock said the banks would
likely shift lending habits, even if
SVB was a freak event, potentially
sending companies back to capital
markets.
Moody’s also forecast a more
muted approach to lending from the
US banks in the face of the “rapidly
deteriorating operating environ-
ment”. The ripples from this ﬁrst
pebble have already proved serious.
The consequences of any further
crises could be far more violent.

overnment plans to loosen
immigration rules to allow
more foreign construction
workers into the UK will help to
ease shortages in an industry that is
struggling to recruit enough workers,
the heads of industry bodies said.
Even with the UK economy facing
a potential recession this year, the
construction industry needs to
recruit an additional 45,000 workers
per year “just to maintain output”,
said Suzannah Nichol, chief execu-
tive of industry body Build UK.
These additional workers are
needed on top of the 190,000
employees required just to replace
those leaving an industry with an
annual churn rate of about 8 per
cent, according to the Construction
Industry Training Board. The short-
age is industry-wide but is most
acute among civil engineers, other
construction professionals, technical
staﬀand plant operatives.
“Many of the roles in our industry
are more skilled than people think,
with years of training required,”
Nichol said. “We are being asked to
build now, not in several years’ time,
so it is vital that we have an immi-
gration policy that allows businesses
to quickly address shortages around
particular occupations.”
Last week, the Financial Times
reportedthatthegovernment’smigra-
tion advisory committee has recom-
mended that key trades such as
bricklayers,carpenters,plasterersand
roofers are added to a “shortage occu-
pation list”. This would allow employ-
ers to bring in staﬀon a lower salary
thanthecurrentskilledworkerthresh-
old of £25,600 and cut visa fees.
Holding up work
The Federation of Master Builders
(FMB) said that around a third of
its members (typically small- and
medium-sized enterprises) were
struggling to hire carpenters and
bricklayers. This “is causing 60 per
cent of jobs to be delayed, curtailing
the ability of the building industry
to grow”, FMB chief executive Brian
Berry said.
Overall employment numbers
in the construction industry have
dropped by 11 per cent since the
start of 2019, said Simon Rawlinson,
head of strategic research and insight
at consultancy Arcadis. Although
the industry continued to operate
largely unabated throughout the
pandemic, he attributed some of
the decline to workers choosing to
return to Europe or not to take up
UK residency.
Workers from the European
Union had helped to plug a gap that
occurred in the wake of the global
ﬁnancial crisis when a severe down-
turn “saw a lot of people come out
Construction industry calls
for overseas labour help
The construction industry needs an additional 45,000 workers a year
to meet demand despite the economic slowdown. Michael Fahy reports
of the industry and never go back”,
explained Kelly Boorman, head of
construction at accountancy ﬁrm
RSM. However, given an 8 per cent
decline in the number of foreign
workers in construction over the
past three years, the industry has
also become top-heavy in terms of
its age proﬁle, she added. Over a ﬁfth
of the sector’s workforce is now over
55, compared with just 11 per cent
in 2003.
Important knowledge and techni-
cal skills will be lost as they retire,
and although the industry has been
focused on training younger workers
in these areas “there’s a whole raft in
the middle [30-45-year-olds] that’s
missing”, Boorman said.
She questioned whether loosen-
ing immigration rules will easily
address the decline in technical skills
knowledge, but said it would beneﬁt
an industry facing “serious” labour
shortages. Active vacancies in the
sector are still more than 50 per cent
higher than pre-pandemic levels,
according to ONS data, although
Morgan Sindall (MGNS) manage-
ment said last week that labour costs
had dropped while ground worker
availability had increased recently.
The sector is also dealing with
another labour challenge. The
number of self-employed workers
has fallen 23 per cent since the start
of 2019, according to Rawlinson.
Changes to oﬀ-payroll working rules
(also known as IR35) are seen as
contributing to this.
Since April 2021, large- and
mid-sized corporates hiring subcon-
tractors have been responsible for
deciding whether they should be
deemed employees or service provid-
ers, whereas previously they could
self-declare. As a result, self-em-
ployed people as a share of the indus-
try’s total workforce have fallen 41
per cent to 35 per cent, according to
Rawlinson.
“That greater preponderance of
direct employment favours the route
of sponsoring labour from over-
seas.” And where are all these work-
ers going to come from? “Anywhere,”
said Rawlinson. Just as long as the
government gets on board.

NEWS ANALYSIS
I
n a matter of weeks, the weight
loss drug Wegovy has leapt into the
public consciousness. The once-
weekly injection, which suppresses
appetite, is thought to be the most
effective anti-obesity treatment
ever brought to market. Shares in
its manufacturer, Novo Nordisk
(US:NVO), have soared by more than
33 per cent in the past six months as
the buzz around the drug grew.
Unlike some of the weight loss treat-
ments available before it, Wegovy is
backed by truly compelling scientiﬁc
evidence. Individuals who received
the drug in one 68-week trial of
around 1,900 people lost an average
of 12.4 per cent of their body weight
compared with those who were given
a placebo. The challenge now facing
Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (US:LLY),
which makes a rival product called
Mounjaro, is convincing healthcare
systems to cover the cost of the treat-
ment for the many people who could
beneﬁt from it.
Here in the UK, the National
Institute for Health and Care
Excellence, a medical watchdog,
recently recommended that Wegovy
be made available to select NHS
patients. To qualify for the treatment,
someone must have a body mass index
(BMI) score of 35, as well as at least
one comorbid condition linked to
obesity. However, when the drug was
approved in the US in 2021, regulators
at the Food and Drug Administration
deemed the drug suitable for patients
with a BMI of 27 or greater and at least
one weight-related ailment.
Despite its proven eﬃcacy, payers
such as insurance companies seem
reluctant to ﬁnance or reimburse it.
It has been reported that 60 to 70 per
cent of commercial insurance plans
in the US don’t cover anti-obesity
medications, while only a handful of
the country’s government-funded
Medicare and Medicaid insurance
programmessupportweightlossdrugs.
Eric Le Berrigaud, a healthcare
analyst at investment bank Stifel,
said forthcoming results from a study
of Wegovy’s potential heart bene-
ﬁts could be a catalyst for a further
rush on the drug. Some analysts
had predicted that the cardiovascu-
lar outcomes trial would have been
wound down in the third quarter of
last year following a positive data read-
out. However, Novo Nordisk revealed
last summer that the study would be
seen through to completion – indicat-
ing that clear advantages may not have
been demonstrated.
It’s now expected that the company
willunveilthestudy’sconclusionsinthe
middleofthisyear.“Ifthe[heart]trialis
positive, what that says is that Wegovy
goes beyond weight management, and
it’s going to be more diﬃcult for payers
not to cover these drugs,” Le Berrigaud
said. “If not, that could make the share
price a little bit vulnerable.”
Mixed outcomes
With a list price of over $1,300
(£1,069) for a month’s supply, it’s
little wonder that payers want proof
that the drug can improve longer-
term health outcomes in addition to
lowering an individual’s BMI.
Demand skyrockets for
weight loss ‘wonder drugs’
Wegovy and other similar products are highly effective. But physicians and payers
are increasingly wondering about the practicality of its long-term use. Jennifer Johnson reports
The prevalence of obesity in the US
is thought to be somewhere around 42
per cent of the population. In the UK,
meanwhile, one in four adults is obese
– a signiﬁcant potential market.
One study from the University of
Liverpool found that people who lost
weight when taking semaglutide, the
generic name for Wegovy, regained
two-thirds of what they lost in the ﬁrst
year after discontinuing the medica-
tion. But some cardiovascular meas-
urements, such as cholesterol levels,
remained lower in the population that
received the drug and not a placebo.
“Although a net beneﬁcial eﬀect on
several cardiometabolic parameters
was maintained one year after sema-
glutide withdrawal, greater beneﬁts
wereseenduringthetreatmentperiod,
supporting the need for continued
treatment,” the researchers reported.
Novo Nordisk itself has also
acknowledged that Wegovy, and
medicines that work like it, have
possible side-effects that include
thyroid tumours and thyroid cancer.
Thyroid tumours were observed in
studies with rodents, meaning the
drug is not recommended for those
with a family history of certain
thyroid cancers.
Nonetheless, there is already strong
demand for these treatments from
people willing to pay out of pocket, so
the outlook for sales is positive regard-
less of what payers decide. “There’s
so much chatter in online forums and
in the street about these weight loss
drugs,” said Sebastian Skeet, senior
healthcare sector analyst at invest-
ment research firm Third Bridge.
“Doctors have told me that they’ve had
patients come in and ask: how do I get
my hands on Wegovy?”

T
he results of the world’s largest
trial of a four-day working week
arein.Andjudgingbytheheadline
ﬁgures, it was a roaring success.
Ateamofsocialscientistsatthe
University of Cambridge followed 61 organi-
sations (and their 2,900 employees) as they
introduced a 20 per cent reduction in work-
ing hours – with no corresponding drop in
pay. The scheme was a hit with workers – 71
per cent of employees reported lower levels
of“burnout”,while60percentfounditeasier
to combine work and care responsibilities.
More surprisingly, it was a hit with compa-
nies,too:revenuesbarelychangedduringthe
trialperiod,and92percentofﬁrmsintendto
continue with the four-day week.
It looks like a win-win situation. But is it
too good to be true?
Atitscore,afour-dayworkingweekrequires
workers to do the same amount of work in 20
per cent less time – and this requires a signif-
icant increase in productivity. In October,
employers told the Chartered Institute of
Personnel and Development (CIPD) that they
wouldneedtoincreaseproductivityby“work-
ingsmarterand/orinvestmentintechnology”
to reduce hours without cutting pay, and the

Results from the world’s
largest trial are in…
If high inflation lasts for years, central
bankers will have to get creative
Take a cursory glance at the chart below, and
it looks as though inﬂation is on its way back
down. There are certainly grounds for opti-
mism: trends in commodity prices, energy
and shipping markets have been moving in
the right direction.
As noted last week, markets are already
looking forward to interest rate cuts, with
ﬁnancial conditions loosening as a result.
There are even lingering hopes of ‘immac-
ulate disinﬂation’ and ‘soft landings’, which
could see inﬂation fall with little adverse
impact on jobs and growth.
But inflation has caught us off guard
before. Take the case of ‘transient inﬂation’
in 2021. The idea that soaring prices were
driven by temporary bottle-necks and statis-
tical base eﬀects convinced even the Fed. Are
we at risk of falling for the wrong economic
narrative again today?
Chris Turner, global head of markets at
ING,notedlastweekthat“asweenterMarch,
whathasbecomecleartoﬁnancialmarketsis
thatinﬂationisprovingfarstickierthanmost
had felt at the start of the year”. Meanwhile,
César Pérez Ruiz, chief investment oﬃcer at
Pictet Asset Management, said that “recent
data suggests achieving 2 per cent inﬂation
remains a distant target for central banks,
with strong services and labour markets
supporting price rises”. It could be time to
consider a less benign inﬂation outcome.
In February, economist and Allianz chief
economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian listed
three possible scenarios for the US economy.
First (and best) is the ‘immaculate disinﬂa-
tion’ scenario that has generated so much
hope – but El-Erian thinks that the probabil-
ity of this materialising is only 25 per cent.
Soberingly,heseesanequalprobabilityofthe
US experiencing “U inﬂation” – where inﬂa-
tion increases later this year – thanks to the
price pressures generated by a strong labour
market and a recovering Chinese economy.
A more likely outcome is that inﬂation
falls this year – just not all the way back to
target. This would leave the Fed facing an
unpalatable decision: should it squeeze the
economy to get inﬂation back down to 2 per
cent, wait to see if the US can cope with 3-4
per cent inﬂation, or even adjust the inﬂa-
tion target? El-Erian puts the probability of
this kind of sticky situation at 50 per cent.
In the UK, policymakers could soon face
a similar dilemma. Former Bank of England
(BoE) chief economist Andy Haldane has
argued there is, in theory, the option to
extend the horizon over which inﬂation
returns to target or even suspend the inﬂa-
tion target altogether. Haldane argued that
“ﬂexing horizons, rather than the targets
themselves, would protect the economy in
the near term, while leaving inﬂation teth-
ered to target over the medium term”.
Over the longer run, it is worth keeping an
evenmoreopenmind:iftheﬁghtagainstinﬂa-
tion drags on for years, policymakers might
have to start thinking outside the box.

not increase worker happiness.
A four-day week is not a new idea: in 1930,
economist John Maynard Keynes predicted
that younger generations would work a
15-hour week as economic progress let them
meet their material needs with less toil. But
it could help to solve some very modern
post-pandemicproblems,too.TheCambridge
study reported that managers saw the four-
day week as a “rational response to the
pandemic”, and believed it would give them
an edge when it came to attracting talent in
the post-Covid job market.
Will it be more widely adopted in the
future? Several ﬁrms have tried.
The trendsetters
In the UK, J Sainsbury (SBRY) launched a
trial to oﬀer workers the option of working
four days a week. The trial is designed to give
staﬀmore ﬂexibility, but the option has only
beenextendedtoworkersinitsheadoﬃcesin
Holborn,CoventryandMiltonKeynes,aswell
asitswarehouseandstoremanagers.Dunelm
(DNLM), a high-street retailer, will trial a
hybrid four-day work week in select depart-
ments with a view to extending the scheme.
Microsoft (US:MSFT) was a trendsetter
when it came to the four-day working week.
In 2019, it conducted a month-long four-day
work week trial. And the results were posi-
tive–productivitywasreportedlyboostedby
40 per cent. This in part led to the Japanese
government unveiling new economic guide-
lines in 2021 that encouraged companies to
adopt a reduced working week.
Cambridge study found evidence of similar
behaviour:shortermeetings,interruption-free
‘focus periods’ and reforming email etiquette
were all used to drive eﬃciency gains.
Productivity-boosting measures could
have positive macroeconomic impacts, too.
The CIPD report noted that improvements in
productivityare“urgentlyneeded”tocombat
inﬂation and achieve sustainable improve-
ments to wages as the UK seeks to navigate
the cost of living crisis.
But it wasn’t all good news. The Cambridge
study found that staﬀat one large company
(only12percentoftheﬁrmstrackedemployed
more than 101 workers) had concerns about
“intensifying workloads” and some creative
companies felt that ‘focus periods’ made it
hardertocollaborateonnewideas.Areduced

There could be drawbacks at a macroe-

professor at the University of Cork, points out
thatreducingworkinghoursby20percentwill
seetotalgrossdomesticproduct(GDP)dropby
20 per cent unless output per hour increases

which shortened its work week from 46 to 30

enough to compensate.
Increases in employee wellbeing could
prove short-lived, too: France reduced the

ﬁx the UK’s
trade deﬁcit?
What is the UK’s trade position?
A trade deﬁcit (also called a current account
deﬁcit) occurs when a country’s imports
exceed its exports. And the UK economy is
wrestling a huge one.
First, some good news. Trade ﬁgures
released last week showed that the trade
deﬁcit narrowed in January, and the sharp
drop in wholesale gas prices should see the
underlying trade deﬁcit fall further in the
coming months.
But deeper problems remain. Last
month, UK exports of goods were 9.4 per
cent below their 2018 (pre-Brexit and
pre-Covid-19) levels (see chart, page 18).
By contrast, exports from all advanced
economies were 3.8 per cent above their
2018 average by November of last year.
Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist
at Pantheon Macroeconomics, expects the
deﬁcit to narrow this year, but remain far
above 2021 levels.
Is it a problem?
A current account deﬁcit means that the
UK is a ‘net borrower’ with the rest of the
world. To ﬁnance our current account deﬁ-
cit, we need to attract ﬁnancial inﬂows. If
we can’t, sterling would have to depreci-
ate enough to close the gap in our external
accounts, triggering a so-called balance of
payments crisis.
Last year, economists feared that
economic and political upheaval could
leave foreign investors less willing to fund
the UK’s external deﬁcit. In the wake of
the fallout from the ‘mini’ Budget, Paul
Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal
Studies think tank, argued that “concur-
rent large ﬁscal and current account deﬁ-
cits made markets seriously nervous when
big, unfunded tax cuts were announced”.
Although fears of a current account
crisis proved overblown, they haven’t

entirely disappeared. Bank of America
FX strategist Kamal Sharma warned
earlier this year that “the trend deterio-
ration in the UK’s external trade position
remains a worrying one and leaves the
currency vulnerable to the kind of pres-
sure seen in September 2022”.
But at the same time, it is worth noting
that an improving balance of trade posi-
tion isn’t automatically good news: the
reason for the realignment matters. Our
trade deﬁcit with the EU may well narrow
over the coming months if the UK econ-
omy deteriorates, reducing demand for
European imports as euro area demand
for UK goods and services remains strong.
When it comes to the trade balance, be
careful what you wish for.
Will the Northern Ireland
protocol agreement improve
the UK’s trade position?
On the plus side, it seems likely that the
deal will improve the economic perfor-
mance of some import-intensive businesses
in Northern Ireland. But unfortunately,
the direct impacts on trade will proba-
bly be limited. Analysis from Pantheon
Macroeconomics highlights that Northern
Ireland accounts for just 2.2 per cent of
UK GDP (for context, Wales and Scotland
account for 3.4 and 7.4 per cent, respec-
tively), meaning that the new deal will not
materially change the outlook for UK trade
as a whole.
SimonFrench,chiefeconomistatPanmure
Gordon,stressesthatfrictionstoUK-EUtrade
remain unaﬀected by the deal, and is scep-
tical of claims that it could unlock billions
of pounds worth of business investment into
the UK. Nevertheless, he adds that the deal
“reduces the risks facing investors looking to
allocate to the UK”, and “represents a more
helpful backdrop for capital deepening, a
re-ratingofUKpubliccompaniesandupward
momentum for the UK pound”.
French thinks that the potential impact
on sentiment could be signiﬁcant, with the
deal representing a transition from the
“moaning teenager” stage of negotiations
to a “more mature” phase. Economists at
Pantheon Macroeconomics also hailed the
impact on business conﬁdence, noting that
“at least the direction of travel in EU rela-
tions is now positive, and businesses have
less to fear”.

How to achieve a
sustainable level
of drawdown
To determine a sustainable withdrawal rate you need to consider
a number of factors. Leonora Walters reports
I
f you rely on your investments for income
– because you are in retirement, for exam-
ple – you need to ensure they can continue
to provide that income for as long as you
need it, and you shouldn’t draw more
than is sustainable. What is harder to deter-
mine, however, is what a ‘safe’ withdrawal
rate is as this depends on a number of vary-
ing factors including ones unique to yourself.
Rob Morgan, chief analyst at Charles Stanley,
argues that: “The uncertainty of those vari-
ables means there is no ‘safe’ level. Rather,
there is a range of outcomes with diﬀerent
levels of probability.”
Four per cent of the value of your port-
folio a year is often cited as an amount you
can safely withdraw without the risk of
assets running out before the end of your
life. However, this assumption was made
by US ﬁnancial adviser Bill Bengen in the
mid-1990s on the basis of stock and bond
returns between 1926 and 1976 – and the
future could look very diﬀerent.
A withdrawal rate of 4 per cent of the
value of your portfolio a year “does give you
a good chance of not running your pot down,
but the risks associated with volatility drag
and the sequencing of returns mean that you
have to be very careful and aware of what
might go wrong”, says Morgan. “In particu-
lar, when market volatility strikes, there can
be a signiﬁcant impact on investors taking
regular or ad-hoc withdrawals.”
Volatilitydragreferstothefactthataport-

will not be £100,000 but £99,000.
The sequencing of returns, as Morgan
says, can have a disproportionate eﬀect on
outcomes.Negativereturnsintheearlyyears
can have a particularly detrimental eﬀect on
thevalueofaninvestmentpoteveniftheyare
followed by good returns. Similarly, taking
money out of a portfolio shortly after market
falls risks depleting your assets too early.
With this in mind, it is particularly impor-
tant not to withdraw too much too early, as
the table below shows.
If you have a smaller base of assets, you
also reduce the potential for income because
you have fewer units and shares in invest-
ments to pay it out.
So it may be the case that you should take
less than 4 per cent a year if, for example,
your portfolio is only returning 3-4 per cent
a year and at that point, you are not look-
ing to run down capital. Alternatively, when
markets are falling you may need to factor in
periods when you totally stop withdrawing
from your investments. At such times, you
could continue to take dividends and inter-
est from the investments but draw the rest
of your income from a cash reserve instead
of also selling chunks of investments. If you
are retired and your investments contrib-
ute to your annual income, advisers suggest
having around two years’ worth of expendi-
ture in easily accessible cash.
One way to try to determine a sustaina-
ble withdrawal rate is to identify the likely
income ﬂows from the investment portfo-
lio, and use this as the basis for the amount
it is safe to draw without eating into any
capital. You then just take the income the
portfolio naturally produces rather than
committing to a ﬁxed level of withdrawals.

FINANCIAL PLANNING DRAWDOWN
stable, whereas relying on top-slicing growth
investments could make you more prone to
sequencing risk,” says Morgan.
However, this level of income will not
be enough for everyone, and investment
income is often variable in any case. On top
of this, a laser focus on income may mean
you miss out on investments that mostly
grow your capital instead.
Morgan notes that, ideally, you should
hold both growth and income investments,
and take the natural income from the part
that produces it.
Paul Derrien, investment director at
Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management,
agrees that you should diversify across both,
andalsospreadassetsacrossavarietyofother
equity styles, such as value and growth. For
example,“incomeasastylewasgreatin2022
buttherearemanyyearswhenithasn’tbeen,
so a diversiﬁed style approach is likely to
producebetterandmoreconsistentreturns”,
heexplains.“Thisismuchmorehelpfulwhen
taking regular withdrawals as you want to
avoid as many shocks as possible.”
Focusing on both income and growth
means that you can make use of more tax
allowances.Ifyouaresellingchunksofinvest-
mentsheldoutsidetaxwrapperssuchasindi-
vidual savings accounts (Isas) and pensions,
trimming holdings that have done well up to
a value of your capital gains tax (CGT) allow-
ance is a good way to prevent a large CGT
liability building up. With the annual CGT
allowancefallingfrom£12,300to£6,000on6
Aprilandagainto£3,000inApril2024,doing
this is going to become even more important
(see ‘Beat tax rises with a ﬂexible income
plan’, IC, 10 March 2023).
Planning factors
To help determine a suitable withdrawal rate
for you personally, consider what income
you will need and what costs you might incur
during the rest of your life. Typically, the
earlier part of your retirement costs more
than later years because you may be travel-
ling, pursuing hobbies or making improve-
ments to your home. Ian Cook, financial
planner at Quilter, says that by your mid-70s
thelevelofincomeyouneedmayreduce,and
thisisevenmorelikelyinyour80s.However,
that can change if you need to fund care or
helparoundthehome.Soconsiderthelevelof
investmentincomeyoumayneedatdiﬀerent
stages of your retirement.
Key things to factor in include your age
and life expectancy, and the value of your
portfolio. For example, if you are age 80 and
withdraw 5 per cent a year from a portfolio
worth hundreds of thousands of pounds that
returns 4 per cent a year, you are unlikely to
run out of assets before the end of your life.
The purpose of your withdrawals is also an
importantconsideration.“Ifitisawithdrawal
to supplement income, it needs to keep pace
with inﬂation,” says Derrien. “However, it is
unlikely that your income requirements will
be constant each year for various reasons
[including] age, family circumstances and
unexpectedone-oﬀs,sosomeﬂexibilityneeds
to be built in too.”
He likes to plan on the basis that assets
will only diminish to zero well beyond aver-
age life expectancy – for example, beyond
age 100. “That way there is a good buﬀer for
the odd black swan or two,” he says. “Plan
for the worst or lower returns than you actu-
ally expect.”
A key factor is whether you plan to leave
a legacy to children or other beneﬁciaries.
However, if not being able to draw on some
or all of your capital would compromise your
ﬁnancial security and standard of living in
retirement, consider either not leaving a
legacy or just a smaller one – perhaps simply
anything that is left after you have met your
ﬁnancial needs.
Also factor in any new income streams
that may occur and would mean you can
reduce your annual level of withdrawals –
for example, your own and/or your spouses’
state pension. Cook says to consider whether
the state pension will cover your basic
expenses and, if not, look at buying an annu-
ity to make up the diﬀerence. “This would
mean that your basic costs are covered irre-
spective of your age,” he says.
It would also mean that you are not
forced to withdraw from your investments
when their value has fallen, as discretion-
ary spending could be put on hold or funded
with other assets.
The impact of tax on withdrawals should
also be factored in. Advisers generally
suggest ﬁrst drawing from assets outside
pensions and Isas, up to a value within your
tax allowances (such as the personal allow-
ance for income tax, dividend allowance and
personal savings allowance for interest from
cash and bond investments). Then withdraw
from Isas because withdrawals from these
are tax free.
“If in retirement, build a secure income
using various sources to cover your basic
needs,” says Morgan. “Another way to
minimise tax is to put any investments
outside Isas or pensions in joint names for a
couple,orinthenameofthespousewhopays
the lowest rate of tax.”
Pensions are the ﬁnal type of account you
should turn to, starting with the 25 per cent
tax-free portion. Leaving your pension until
last is especially important if you want to
leave assets to beneﬁciaries after you die,
because these do not fall into your estate for
inheritance tax purposes, whereas Isas and
other types of account do.
Portfolio performance
Consider what kind of growth your invest-
ments might achieve, remembering to factor
in inﬂation, perhaps using a long-term aver-
age ﬁgure but bearing in mind that there can
be periods when price growth is excessively
high, such as at present.
Derrien says to assess the returns that
your portfolio could achieve given its risk
level, and to be realistic with your assump-
tions on growth and inﬂation. You should
periodically assess whether the performance
is as desired, bearing in mind that market
ﬂuctuations are unavoidable.
Many ﬁnancial planners suggest assessing
your portfolio around once a year, although
Cook says you could review it up to four
times a year. However, he adds that you
should assess its track record in relation to
the market over at least three years.
Examining your portfolio in this way
doesn’t mean you have to trade holdings, a
process that incurs charges that cut into your
returns. Valid reasons to buy and sell invest-
ments include rebalancing to take the asset
allocationbacktoyourdesiredstartingpoint.

Former IC writer Claer Barrett explains why she wrote a book about good money habits
F
rom volatile markets to
prolonged high inﬂation and
higher taxes, investors have
plenty of tricky issues to navi-
gate right now. Nevertheless,
an investor’s chief problem is highly
likely to be themselves.

tive ﬁnancial decision-making (you’ll

1949 book TheIntelligentInvestor).
Most investors know where to ﬁnd

peoplelikeusareinaminority.
I can’t and won’t pretend to hold a
candle to the investment greats, but
I know that some of these valuable
habits need to be instilled in the next
generation of investors and that is
whatIhopemybook–WhatTheyDon’t
Teach You About Money – can achieve.
Savings have been the ﬁrst casualty
of the cost of living crisis. People were
chronicallyundersavingforretirement
anyway, yet now rising numbers have
stopped paying into their pensions,
plenty of households lack a meaning-
ful savings buﬀer and credit card debt
is at record levels.
Furtheruptheincomescale,costlier
bills and mortgage payments are tear-
ing a hole in the household budgets of
people aﬄuent enough never to have
botheredmuchaboutbudgetingbefore.
Time poor
Frighteningtimes,butifwearetotake
any small positive from this, it’s that
people are having to focus on their
ﬁnances in ways they never have done
before. Many may regret not having
done so sooner – but it’s never too late.
And harking back to Graham, admit-
tingthatweneedsomehelpcanbethe
biggest barrier.
One of the perennial problems with
managing money is that we all have
far too much going on in our lives to
focusonitproperly.Ioncecoveredthe
story of a ﬁnance director of a listed
companywhohadtoresignafterbeing
declared bankrupt by HMRC — a fate
he would have avoided if he had only
opened the post!
Lastyear,anaccountantadmittedshe

ance starts to be clawed back). Worse,
she knew she could have avoided this
bysacriﬁcingmoreofhersalaryintoher
pension,butshewassimplytoobusyto
putthearrangementsinplace.
So why does this happen? In my
experience, most people have dozens
of money questions they secretly want
to know the answers to, but (assum-
ing they can’t aﬀord to pay for inde-
pendent ﬁnancial advice) don’t know
who to ask. We also don’t want to look
stupidbyadmittingwedon’tknowthe
basics. This is especially the case for
professionals who work in one area of
the ﬁnancial world, yet ﬁnd this has
not proved to be an advantage with
their personal ﬁnances.
Other examples include people on
six-ﬁgure salaries who have allowed
every pay rise to inﬂate their lifestyle,
and have virtually nothing in savings.
Thenthere’sthehigh-earningself-em-
ployed professional who thought he
was being diligent by setting his tax
money aside into a stocks and shares
Isa,yethadTeslaasthesingleholding.
Education is essential
As our ﬁnances come under more
pressure, educating ourselves about
money is no longer optional – it’s
essential. Yet, as the title of my book
attests, learning how to manage
money is not something we are
explicitly taught in schools, colleges,
universities or the workplace.
My book is squarely aimed at
younger people on less glitzy sala-
ries. They have less capacity than
older generations might have done
to bounce back from big financial
mistakes, yet are similarly tempted
by easy credit, buy now, pay later and
the allure of ‘shortcuts to wealth’ such
as crypto and day trading.
The good news? They are much
more open to learning about money,
but social media apps such as TikTok
and Instagram are where they go to
educate themselves. The informa-
tion on oﬀer can be very hit-and-miss,
but it is sought-after. The growth of
personalﬁnancecontentontheseplat-
forms has been huge, and the ability
to be connected with hundreds if not
thousands of people who share the
same ﬁnancial fears and challenges as
theydoshouldnotbeunderestimated.
I have attempted to embody this
spirit in the lessons I have to pass
on. I freely admit my own mistakes
(there have been plenty), and explain
ﬁnancial concepts in a way anyone
can understand (for example, the
tasty ‘free money’ of tax relief and
employer pension contributions).
I also include anonymous ﬁnancial
confessions of people who have over-
come the odds to transform their own
relationship with money.
In truth, the most important
lessons have not changed much since
Graham’s day. Spending less than
you earn. Investing little and often.
Getting compound interest to work
for you, rather than against you.
Making use of tax breaks, keeping
costs to a minimum and developing
an awareness of how our emotions
aﬀect our ﬁnancial decisions.

You have managed your investments well and
built up a good level of wealth. But this means
potentially incurring IHT and the pensions life-

steps now to improve your position.
Do you spend all your income or have a
surplus? To mitigate your IHT liability, you
coulduseanexemptioncalled‘regulargiftsout
of income’. As long as you meet certain criteria
set by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), you
could gift some of your surplus income to your
child on a regular basis. But ensure that these
gifts are from income and that making them
does not impact your standard of living.

make a gift outright to your child or, if you want
more control, get professional advice and set
up a trust with your child as a beneficiary. Keep
records of any gifts you make because they will

As well as Isas, consider investing some of
your money in other tax-efficient wrappers.

is lower than income tax and IHT, if your wife
is a basic-rate taxpayer, you could gift shares
into her name to fully use her rate and allow-
ances. Another option is to hold most of your
dividend-paying investments within Isas via
an annual ‘bed and Isa’. This would enable
you to maximise your Isa efficiency, as any
Isa income is tax free. Also, under flexible Isa
rules, withdrawals can be added back in the
tax year they were made without impacting
your annual Isa allowance.
Given your desire for smaller company
exposure, part of your Isa could be invested
in Aim shares, which would shelter some of
your estate from IHT after you had held them
for two years.
You have picked some good companies and
funds, but would benefit from some strategic
asset allocation. The risk/reward ratio of fixed
income has changed – you can now get a 4 per
cent yield on a bond, which would reduce your
portfolio’s risk and increase your overall diver-

such as energy transition and healthcare.
The dividend tax and CGT allowances are
set to fall drastically over the next two tax
years, which will impact around 40 per cent
of your investable assets as they are in taxa-
ble accounts.
You want an average annual total return of
8 to 10 per cent, but financial planning could
provide added savings. Holding the most effi-

helps. For example, offshore bonds and trusts
can be beneficial for investors who have used

nvestment trusts (ITs) make up a
decent slice of the UK’s listed stocks,
with more than 450 listed in London
spread across 70 discrete market
sectors with an aggregated market
value of around £325bn, with four
listed on the FTSE 100 and more than
50 on the FTSE 250. They have been
around as a class of investment vehi-
cle for more than 150 years, yet many
people are likely to be less than fully
informed about them.
Like a unit trust or other fund
investments, ITs are a pooled invest-
ment collective that allow investors
to achieve diversiﬁcation (typically
meaning lower risk) in a single invest-
ment. They have a live price that is
connected to the underlying asset
value of the investments and can be
readily traded/liquidated by private
investors. So they sound like other
investment funds, and this raises the
question of why they need to exist at
all. Surely investors wanting to buy a
ready-diversiﬁed focused investment
class would just buy a fund fulfill-
ing their objectives from one of the
big-name investment houses? Quite
right, but there are a number of key
diﬀerences that make ITs potentially
a lot more interesting and attractive.
Trusts versus funds
Inpractice,therearemanydiﬀerences
between ITs and either unit trusts
(UTs) or the more typical investment
funds known as open-ended invest-
ment companies (Oeics); some are
trivial, but others are materially more
signiﬁcant.
Companies not funds: ITs are fully
listedcompanieswithaboardofdirec-
tors,andcomewithalloftheotherlegal
requirements expected of a quoted
company. The shares are bought and
soldthroughbrokersratherthantrad-
ing directly with the fund manager
or selling through a platform such
as AJ Bell, Hargreaves Lansdown or
Fidelity’s Fund Supermarket. This
means that the share price can be
Robin Hardy looks at the key differences between investment trusts and Oeics
technology stocks, bond income or
emerging markets. ITs actually have
more potential scope as they are not
limited only to exchange traded secu-
rities and can invest directly in phys-
ical development and operational
schemes.
Liquidity: this is not typically an issue
but occasionally rears its ugly head. If
for any reason there is a rush to exit a
fund (tax changes, regulation, pariah
investments, etc), investors in Oeics
can ﬁnd that withdrawals are totally
blocked (most often with property
funds), sometimes for many months
(or years in the case of Woodford). As
ITsaresharesinvestorscanalwayssell.
Eventhoughthepriceyoureceivemay
beunattractive,youcanstillwithdraw
when you want.
Timing: trading in ITs is more ﬂexi-
ble in that you choose precisely when
to buy or sell; you pick the time of
the trade and in doing so have more
control over the achieved price. With
Oeics you typically trade only once a
dayandtransactatthenextdailyprice
point. By having to wait, you can be
disadvantaged. As ITs are exchange
traded, investors have the potential to
act on price slumps and spikes.
Management: there are major diﬀer-
ences here. In an Oeic the fund
impacted by the weight of supply and
demand for a ﬁnite number of shares
as well as by the value of the underly-
ing assets owned.
Open versus closed: this is a major
difference, with ITs being ‘closed-
ended’ while Oeics are ‘open’. This
means that ITs have a ﬁxed amount of
capital to invest (they can raise more
but only by issuing shares or taking on
debt) whereas Oeics are ‘concertinas’,
abletoexpandwithnewinvestorfunds
or shrink if funds are withdrawn.
Control: both types of fund invest in
businessesinwhichtheytypicallyhave
little management control or inﬂu-
ence – unless they own a major stake,
but that is relatively rare, certainly
for Oeics. Certain types of IT may,
however,havesomelevelofinﬂuence,
especially where they are providing a
substantial amount of the total capital

time-limited project.
Focus: both types of investment are
likely to have an investment skew,
bias or focus, say: North America,

WHY CHOOSE TO BUY
AN INVESTMENT TRUST?
Trusts are slightly more complex instruments
than simple funds and are perhaps better suited
to the slightly more sophisticated and/or expe-
rienced investor who understands the addi-
tional complexity of things such as gearing or
premium/discount mechanisms, but this should
not scare investors away.
If dealing with a like-for-like investment profile
the advantages of buying an IT rather than an
Oeic are moderate, but over the long term ITs are
likely to deliver greater stability, better perfor-
mance and a more stable income stream. Both
types of collective fund can be held within a tax
wrapper such as an individual savings account
(Isa) or self-invested personal pension (Sipp)
and ITs typically carry no special exemptions
for inheritance tax (IHT). However, where the
real advantages arise are where there is access
to investment classes not readily available in
listed equities such as infrastructure projects
directly or in private equity investments. These
are inherently more risky, but that can mean a
far more attractive reward in return.
There is also the possibility of picking up
good assets at sometimes sizable discounts, and
conversely there can sometimes be an opportu-
nity to sell into a premium. For many, however,
the dividend smoothing effect means investors
can buy and forget with greater confidence when
seeking income.
2022 was a tough year for UK-listed ITs, with
only around 20 making a positive return during
the year, and a number of good and well-run
funds are standing at a discount to their net
asset value. Many observers think that the UK
markets are undervalued so if there is an invest-
ment trust standing at a discount, that could
potentially mean value squared. ITs do involve
a little more work when looking at the valuation,
but that is something we will look into in the next
article in this series.
Investors’ Chronicle | 17 - 23 March 2023 | 27
manager essentially makes all invest-
ment decisions with little recourse to
anyone else. This can have unfavour-
able outcomes, again think Woodford.
In an IT, there is a PLC board that
oversees the actions of the direct fund
managers, which gives an additional
layer of control and accountability to
investors – the board can be voted out
at an annual meeting, for example.
This should mean that more reckless
investment decisions are avoided and
thatmajorinvestmentsbythefundare
better evaluated.
Costs: typically ITs cost less in admin
and overhead charges than Oeics.
Where an Oeic may have an annual
management fee of, say, 0.75 per cent
a year, investors might expect to pay
two-thirds of this for an IT with an
equivalent proﬁle. This may seem
relatively trivial, but across time
(say 25 years) it makes a meaning-
ful diﬀerence.
Pricing: The valuation of both ITs
and Oeics largely reﬂect the net asset
value (NAV) of the investments they
hold – Oeics will post a daily ‘unit
price’ that reflects the raw NAV.
However, the pricing of ITs is diﬀer-
ent, albeit with the same basic NAV as
the root. The share price will typically
be at either a premium or discount
to that underlying NAV. That can be
driven by issues such as concerns as
yet unrealised about a speciﬁc sector,
levels of debt within the trust or just
the basic imbalances of buyers and
sellers. If the markets expect a weight
of money likely to exit, they will push
the share price to a discount, and vice
versa. This can create advantageous
pricing anomalies.
Anothersmalldisadvantagewithan
ITisthattherewillbea‘bid’and‘oﬀer’
price separated by the ‘spread’, mean-
ingyouautomaticallyloseasmallfrac-
tion between the buy and sell price.
Oeics, by contrast, will have a single
buy and sell price.
Gearing: This is a major diﬀerence,
with ITs allowed to take on bank or
other term debt to make or extend
their investments. By contrast, Oeics
may only invest the money that has
been invested with them. Gearing has
a number of advantages: more invest-
ments can be made without resorting
to shareholders to raise new equity;
when interest rates are lower, invest-
ment returns can be improved as debt
isusually‘cheaper’thanequity.Onthe
ﬂipside,wheninterestratesarerising,
returns are dragged down.
Distributions: This is perhaps where
the greatest diﬀerence and greatest
attraction of ITs show through. While
Oeics are required to distribute (or
roll up in an accumulation fund) all
income received, ITs are allowed to
hold back 15 per cent to build a buﬀer
against cuts, defaults, suspensions
and reductions in underlying divi-
dend income. While this could mean a
lower comparable running yield for a
given proﬁle, it has led to signiﬁcantly
smoother income distributions from
ITs in the long term. This manifests
in there being eight trusts that have
50-plus years of unbroken dividend
growth, a further ﬁve with a 40-plus-
year record and another ﬁve with a
20-plus-year record.
Different types of trust
Split capital trusts are relatively rare
but some ITs are known as ‘splits’
and oﬀer diﬀerent equity classes with
differing risk and expected return
proﬁles. Those equity classes can be
at least two of, ranked by risk: zero
dividend prefs (lowest risk), income
shares, annuity shares, ordinary
shares or capital shares.
Many of the UK’s largest listed real
estate businesses today operate as
real estate investment trusts (Reits)
but these are somewhat diﬀerent
to the ITs we are looking at here.
Reits have tight and speciﬁc invest-
ment rules whereas IT’s are able to
adopt many and varied investment
portfolios. Reits can only invest in
income producing real estate, they
are exempt from paying corporation
tax (on income and capital gains) but
are required to distribute at least 90
per cent of pre-tax proﬁt as divi-
dends. There are many other speciﬁc
rules related to ownership levels
and investment proﬁles unique to
this sector and since 2022 Reits do
not have to be listed on a recognised
exchange.

Scientiﬁc advances that make it possible to
ﬁne tune medical treatments have attracted
investors’ attention – but growing costs could
end up curtailing prospects.

Pharma’s pricing
problem
Investors’ Chronicle | 17 - 23 March 2023 | 29
A
simple peptic ulcer could have
proved life-threatening for
suﬀerers less than ﬁve decades
ago. That was before scientists
at a then-minor pharmaceuti-
cal business called Smith, Kline & French
discovered the compound cimetidine in the
mid-1970s. Marketed under the brand name
Tagamet,thedrugpreventstheexcessrelease
ofulcer-causingstomachacids.Itbecamethe
ﬁrst pharmaceutical product to surpass $1bn
(£0.83bn) in annual sales in 1986.
The next drugs to reach – and exceed
– this milestone were also treatments for
very common conditions. The antidepres-
sant Prozac, developed by EliLilly(US:LLY),
made it big shortly after Tagamet. Pﬁzer’s
(US:PFE) cholesterol medication Lipitor
would later become the ﬁrst mega-block-
busterdrugofthe21stcentury.Thisﬁrstcrop
of billion-dollar-earning medicines had an
important feature in common: they could all
be prescribed at a GP’s oﬃce, often without
referral to a specialist.
The economics underpinning these
so-called ‘primary care blockbusters’ is easy
to grasp. At the time they arrived on the
market, they addressed a widespread unmet
medical need. The sheer size of the patient
population meant that these drugs didn’t
needheftypricetagstomakeaproﬁtfortheir
developers.
In the past decade or so, however, high-
er-priced drugs for less common condi-
tions have started to bring in a greater share
of revenue for the biggest pharmaceutical
companies.Astreatmentsbecomefocusedon
ever-smaller groups of patients, questions of
pricing and proﬁt margins are coming to the
fore like never before. Investors will inevita-
bly want to see that share prices can advance
alongside scientiﬁc understanding. But the
cost of new advances, coupled with straining
healthcare systems around the world, mean
pharmaceuticals are now facing a new type
of price pressure.
AbbVie’s (US:ABBV) Humira – which is
approved to treat a number of autoimmune
disorders – is perhaps the deﬁning drug of
the era of speciality medicine. Unlike most
of the primary care blockbusters, its initial
use must be supervised by a doctor who has
expertiseinthepatient’sparticularcondition.
The hugely popular oncology drugs that rose
to prominence over the past decade, such as
Merck’s(US:MRK) Keytruda, also fall under
this speciality umbrella.
Advances in medical science mean that
treatmentscanincreasinglybetailoredtosuit
apatient’sgeneticmake-uporspeciﬁcdisease
subtype. This targeted approach – which also
takesenvironmentalandlifestylefactorsinto
account – has come to be known as precision,
or personalised, medicine. Although still in
itsinfancyfromascientiﬁcperspective,there
are now a number of examples of precision
treatments at work, particularly in oncology.
Most recently, AstraZeneca’s (AZN)
Enhertu was approved in China and the EU
to treat breast cancers that test positive for a
speciﬁcproteincalledHER2.Precisionmedi-
cine is ultimately grounded in the idea that
greater availability of data can help physi-
cians better diagnose and treat disease.
AstraZeneca has already set out its ambition
to become a leader in the ﬁeld – stating that it
aims to have a diagnostic component linked
to each asset in its pipeline.
Commercial logic suggests that payers –
be they individuals, insurance companies or
public healthcare systems – would be willing
to stump up for medicines that are known to
be highly eﬀective. This is certainly part of
the appeal that underpins the market for the
so-called‘orphan’treatmentsforrarediseases,
whose rapid growthistippedto continueover
the next decade. According to commercial
intelligenceproviderEvaluatePharma,thetop
10 biggest orphan drugs will be worth $64bn
globallyby2028,bywhichtimetheywillmake
up a ﬁfth of all non-generic prescription drug
sales,upfrom18percentin2018.Thesestatis-
tics are particularly impressive given that a
disease is only granted orphan status if it
aﬀects fewer than 200,000 people in the US,
or fewer than ﬁve in 10,000 in Europe.
On a company-specific basis, orphan
drugs’ share of revenues is tipped to grow
most substantially at Johnson & Johnson
and AstraZeneca. Evaluate forecasts that
orphan drugs will make up 39 per cent of
AstraZeneca’s sales by 2028, up from 28 per
cent now, and 46 per cent (up from 27 per
cent) at Johnson & Johnson.
Splitting the bill?
For investors, the attractions are clear:
specialised drugs are more expensive and
command higher proﬁt margins. For compa-
nies, an array of tax breaks and carve-outs
are dedicated to orphan drug development
in both the US and Europe. That applies not
justtoestablishedplayersbutalsomorespec-
ulative players. “A huge proportion of early-
stage drug developers that ﬂoated on stock
markets in the past ﬁve years mentioned the
word ‘rare’ [in their prospectus],” says Amy
Brown of Evaluate Vantage, part of Evaluate
Pharma. “Investors love rare disease compa-
nies for the reasons of premium pricing, help
getting to market and faster approval times
from regulators.”
But change could be afoot as politicians
ﬁx their gazes on ballooning post-pandemic
healthcare budgets. Under the US Inﬂation
Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law last
August, some of the drugs that are costliest
to federal insurance programme Medicare
could eventually be subject to mandatory
price cuts. The Act does make an exception
for orphan drugs, but pointedly this is only
for cases where such drugs are approved
for a single treatment. Many orphans have
achieved significant sales by focusing on
multiple diﬀerent diseases, and could ﬁnd
themselves subject to the Act’s price review
policies in the years ahead.
AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso oncology drug, its
biggest seller last year with $5.4bn in reve-
nue – of which $2bn was in the US, equiva-
lent to 4.5 per cent of the company’s total
revenues – is among those that analysts spec-
ulate could fall foul of the initial Medicare
provisions in 2026. But AstraZeneca’s David
Frederickson told analysts in February that
the company did not expect the drug to be
included in the ﬁrst wave of price reviews,
andsuggestedthecompanywouldarguethat
the single-use orphan exemption “could very
well be applied”.
Whichever drugs are targeted by the IRA,
the question of who will pay for niche medi-
cines – and how much – is becoming more
relevant as precision techniques evolve and
pharmaceutical companies come to depend
on orphans to drive revenue.
For now, insulin prices look to be the

sign that big pharma is ﬁnally capitulating to

other insulin makers follow suit.
In any case, these costs pale in comparison
to those levied on specialised drugs, particu-
larly those in the cutting-edge world of gene
therapy.

said it negotiated a “signiﬁcant conﬁdential

ment available to patients in the UK.
Innovative medicines such as Libmeldy
are exempt from the UK’s NHS pricing agree-
ment, known as the Voluntary Scheme for
Branded Medicines Pricing and Access, for
three years. The soaring cost of these innova-
tionsisonereasontheagreement,established
in 2019 partly as a way to boost innovative
drug access in the NHS, has become a source
of contention in recent months.
The scheme was designed to limit the

utory scheme.
This year, drugmakers will be paying 26.5
per cent of their sales back to the UK govern-
ment. Eli Lilly and AbbVie left the scheme
in protest in January. This means they will
now be subject to a 27.5 per cent clawback
payment under the statutory scheme.
According to Rob Kettell, director of
commercial medicines negotiation at NHS
England, the increase in the health service’s
clawback rate reﬂects the faster adoption of
new, higher-priced medicines by the health
service.
Kettell told the Financial Times that the
NHS was accelerating access to innovative
treatments through more creative commer-
cial arrangements. “This is something that
has beneﬁted companies as well as patients.
It means faster access to new patients and
earlier revenues,” he told the paper.
The rebates, while unlikely to make a dent
in pharmaceutical companies’ revenues,
emphasise the growing tension between
healthcaresystemsandtheindustry.Yetthere
remains high unmet medical need in many
rare genetic disorders, including haemo-
philia and sickle-cell anaemia. Cutting-edge
precision medicines oﬀer hope to millions of
patientswithfewotheroptions,buttheydon’t
come cheap. Part of the reason for this is the
fact that the procedures required to create
precisionmedicinesarethemselvescomplex.
CAR-T cancer treatments are one example.
These therapies are speciﬁcally developed
for each individual patient – and essentially
involve reprogramming the immune system
to attack cancer cells.
Process-as-product
The process of creating a CAR-T treatment
takes place over several weeks, during which
time the patient’s blood is sent oﬀto a lab
and then returned once it has been prop-
erly engineered. According to Alex Telford,
a life sciences consultant, these sorts of
procedure-heavy treatments may have a
better chance of defending their premium
prices – and their patents – than some more
standard orphan treatments.
“Certain personalised medicines and gene
therapiesaregoingtobeverydiﬃculttocopy
because of all the logistics that go into them,”
he says. “It’s going to be very hard for generic
manufacturers to come in and do the same
thing.It’snotclearifthesemedicineswillever
really go generic.”
Regulators will soon find themselves
grappling with the unique patent and pric-
ing dilemmas presented by futuristic ther-
apies such as Crispr. Phase 3 trials for a
therapy called exa-cel, developed by Vertex
Pharmaceuticals (US:VRTX) and Crispr
Therapeutics (US:CRSP), are ongoing. The
treatment, which is under review by both the
FDA and the European Medicines Agency,
uses a patient’s own edited stem cells to
produce high levels of foetal haemoglobin in
red blood cells.
The elevation in haemoglobin triggered by
exa-cel has the potential to reduce or elimi-
natedebilitatingsymptomsinbothsicklecell
diseaseandtransfusion-dependentbeta-thal-
assemia(TDT)–anothergeneticblooddisor-
der. Anecdotal accounts suggest exa-cel is
eﬀective, but given that the treatment is still
in development, albeit at an advanced stage,
it’s too early to declare it an unequivocal
success for patients.
Some analysts argue that it’s prudent
to wait on the sidelines while Crispr’s gene
editing procedures are refined. “Current
approaches are ex-vivo, meaning that you
havetotakepatients’cells,dogeneticmanip-
ulation in the lab and then re-infuse those

you just do a simple infusion, that would lead
todiﬀerentcommercialtrajectoriesandmuch
faster uptake.”
There are several in-vivo treatments,
which are injected directly into patients,
in the preclinical stages of development at
Crispr Therapeutics. But there’s still a way to
go before investors will get a glimpse of their
eﬃcacy in a trial setting. For now, it looks as
though exa-cel will almost certainly become
the ﬁrst commercially available treatment
based on the Crispr gene editing technique.

several years, depending on whether the

But this was not a cost that healthcare
systems and patients were ultimately will-
ing to shoulder, according to the company.
“European payers have not yet evolved their
approach to gene therapy in a way that can
recognise the innovation and the expected
life-long beneﬁt of these products,” it said.
The Institute for Clinical and Economic
Review (ICER), an independent US watch-
dog,concludedlastyearthatCSL’sHemgenix
could justify its multimillion-dollar price
tag given its eﬀectiveness. Vertex’s forward
earnings multiple also suggests markets still
feel conﬁdent in payers’ ability to absorb the
potential costs of exa-cel.
However, in its review of Hemgenix, the
ICER said payers should work with manufac-
turers to “develop and implement outcomes-
based agreements to address the uncertainty
andthehighcostofgenetherapies”.Ineﬀect,
this could mean that patients and healthcare
systems only agree to pay full price for a gene
therapy if its impact is curative – or close to
it. In the case of certain rare conditions, a

only the super-rich, rather than healthcare

“I think that understanding the value that
these products bring to patients – and then
endeavouring to ensure that we can manu-
facture those at a scale and at a cost that can
bewidelydistributed–hastobeagoalforthe
industry,” says Doug Doerﬂer, chief execu-
tive of Aim-traded MaxCyte (MXCT), which
works with Crispr-focused companies.
Ultimately, the future for some advanced
therapies may not look so diﬀerent from the
current batch of ‘orphan’ drugs that are used
to treat multiple diseases. Telford predicts
that there could one day be “broad platform
approvals” for gene therapies in conditions
thatshareasimilarpathophysiology,meaning
theyareunitedbyasetofcommonfunctional
characteristics. The underlying causal muta-
tions may, however, diﬀer between patients.
“If you expand the [patient] population
with platform approvals, it’s possible that
payers may say the standard of [clinical]
evidence isn’t good enough,” he said. This
means that these kinds of therapies may
command lower prices if they haven’t been
proven in a highly speciﬁc patient popula-
tion. “But the volume of sales could make up
for that.”

One bargain trade is arguably more obvi-

where a popular investment manager runs
both a closed and open-ended vehicle with a

Dividends payouts are nice but are
they always best?
Dividends are one of the great things about
investment trusts. During downturns they
oﬀer certainty that at least a modicum of
income will come your way.
Theyalsodemonstrateatrust’scommitment
to its shareholders. The latest Association of
InvestmentCompanies’dividendheroestable
lists18truststhathavebeenraisingtheirdivi-
dendseveryyearforatleasttwodecades,with
thetopthree–CityofLondon(CTY),Bankers
InvestmentTrust(BNKR)andAllianceTrust
(ATST) – boasting a whopping 56 consecutive
years of dividend increases.
But the UK market’s relentless focus on
dividends has been called into question many
timesover whatitdoestoitsgrowthprospects.
While dividend reinvestment boosts your
returns, one wonders if payouts represent the
best use of cash in certain cases.
These questions have relevance for invest-
ment trusts, as well as individual companies.
What about the trusts investing in assets that
are not typically income-generating, such
as venture capital trusts or private equity?
Analysts have diﬀerent takes on the topic.
Princess Private Equity (PEY) had to
suspend its second interim dividend last year,
partly because it needed the liquidity to settle
some currency hedging contracts. Earlier
this month the dividend was reinstated, but
Stifelanalystspointedoutthatitwasthethird
time the company had reduced or suspended
payouts in the past 10 years, “terminally”
damaging its appeal to income investors. The
analysts proclaim themselves “wary of divi-
dendspaidbyprivateequityfunds,giventhat
these are essentially returns of capital rather
than covered by revenue earnings”.
On the other hand, other private equity
trusts have continued to pay their dividends
eveninachallengingenvironmentfortheasset
class. Mick Gilligan, head of managed port-
folio services at Killik, argues that venture
capital and private equity trusts paying divi-
dendscreateabroaderdemandfortheirshares
because they can appeal to both income and
growth investors. Meanwhile, any return of
capital, whether through dividends or share
buybacks, can be of help if the trust’s shares
are trading at a discount. “I am comfortable
with this and indeed it helps when construct-
ingportfoliosthathaveahighincomerequire-
ment,” he says.
Oakley Capital (OCI) has an interest-
ing mixed stance. It pays a small dividend,
which partner Steven Tredget says is mostly
a legacy from when the trust used to have
some big income funds among its owners, as
well as constituting a useful “discipline”; but
currently prefers to return capital through
share buybacks. Buybacks are more ﬂexible
than dividends – for one thing, investors are
lesslikelytopenalisemanagementforemploy-
ing them sporadically rather than regularly
– and as such perhaps more suitable for a
growth-focused asset class. Historically, they
haven’t been popular in the private equity
space,butafewprivateequitytrustsdidiniti-
ate them in 2022.
Outside of private equity, Gilligan notes
that other trusts that pay high yields that are
supplemented from capital include many
JPMorganportfolios,suchasJPMorgan China
Growth & Income (JMC) and JPMorgan
European Growth & Income (JEGI). With
more liquid assets, sustaining a dividend paid
outfromcapitaliseasier,althoughthequestion
remains whether it might occasionally force
trusts to sell holdings at a loss.

Some other metrics noted in the table are
worth acknowledging. Big share price falls
can result in attractive dividend yields, even
for funds that are not particularly focused on
income generation, as with Baillie Giﬀord ESG
portfolio Keystone Positive Change (KPC).
It can also be worth asking how much gear-

of higher interest rates investors are question-
ing the reliability of unquoted NAVs, which do
notneedtoberepricedparticularlyregularly.It
is worth noting that Scottish Mortgage applied
a swathe of writedowns to its unquoted port-

Other diﬀerences also matter. Trusts can
prove more volatile in the short run due in

Financial Planning, for one, has become
“more cautious” on trusts over time even if
they outperform. “They are inherently more
risky,youarepayingforthatpotentialoutper-
formance with higher volatility,” he notes.
“Trusts can make their own diversiﬁcation
rules, use leverage and obviously can trade at
a huge surplus or discount to NAV.”
The open-ended option may therefore be a
better ﬁt for some investors such as those in
pensiondrawdownwhocannotendureasteep
fallinvalueorthoseparticularlynervousabout
their investments. There is also no guarantee
atantalisinglywidediscountwillevernarrow,
even though share price returns can still be
strong regardless.
Over a ﬁve-year period Paciﬁc Horizon
(PHI) is some 40 percentage points ahead
of its open-ended equivalent, while names
such as Monks (MNKS) and Polar Capital
Technology (PCT) are among those to have
fared worse than their open-ended counter-
parts when judged by share price total return.
Notethatﬁve-yearﬁgurescanbeoverlyswayed
by particularly big shorter-term movements,
meaning this is just one snapshot in time.
Investors who already hold an open-ended
fund should look for a discount that is big
enoughtojustifyswitchingintothetrustrunby

costs, hassle and even time out of the market.
“You need to take account of dealing costs

investmentdirectorBenYearsley.“Youproba-

It’s ﬁnally worth noting that the diﬀerent
charges platforms levy on trusts (as shares)
and open-ended funds should factor into
the decision. Hargreaves Lansdown custom-
ers, for one, will tend to ﬁnd holding trusts
cheaper than funds – although Yearsley
notes that a fee rebate on the Troy Trojan
fund, combined with the absence of a major
discount on Personal Assets, made him
ultimately opt not to make a switch to the
closed-ended version.

FUNDS SHARES I LOVE
SHARES I LOVE: BANK CENTRAL ASIA
Ayaz Ebrahim, manager of JPMorgan
Asia Growth & Income (JAGI), explains
why the increasing prosperity of Asia’s
burgeoning middle class is set to benefit
Bank Central Asia (ID:BBCA).
“As economies in developed countries
show signs of slowing, there are plenty of
exciting opportunities in Asia. Countries
across this region have large and grow-
ing economies, accounting for roughly
40 per cent of the world’s gross domestic
product. Furthermore, with 60 per cent
of the world’s population – about 4.5bn
people – living in Asia, the rapid rise of
the middle classes is a powerful engine
for growth.
“One sector that has benefited from
the increasing prosperity of Asia’s
expanding middle class is financials.
Innovation in financial products and
services has been widespread in part
due to the swift economic recovery,
which has been especially robust in
Indonesia.
“A standout company benefiting
from this positive long-term trend is
Bank Central Asia. This Indonesian bank
focuses on the transaction banking busi-
ness, and provides credit facilities and
financial solutions for the corporate,
commercial, small- to medium-sized
enterprises and consumer segments. The
bank has recently diversified by develop-
ing a suite of digital products and services
for wealthier consumers in Asia. This
includes vehicle financing, Sharia bank-
ing, securities, insurance products, remit-
tances and venture capital.
“Bank Central Asia is also benefiting
from the digitalisation of the Indonesian
economy. The bank’s digital bank-
ing push has led to a sharp decline in
customer acquisition costs, with total
cost-to-income ratios falling to 35-40
per cent from previous levels of 40-45
per cent.
“Bank Central Asia continues
to provide a suite of services and
expertise to clients across Asia, and its
ability to innovate its digital capabilities
has attracted a range of new clients. So
we expect its positive story of growth
and innovation to continue over the
long-term.” LW
G
raeme Forster, co-manager of
Orbis Oeic Global Equity Fund
(GB00BJ02KW01), explains why he
invests in car maker BMW (DE:BMWX).
“BMW is one of the three mass luxury car
brands,alongwithMercedesBenz(DE:MBG)
andAudi,thatistrulyglobalandcancommand
a premium price. This results in genuinely
attractive long-term growth, proﬁtability
and returns on capital. BMW also owns Rolls-
RoyceMotorCarswhichhassimilardynamics
becauseofitsdominantpositionattheverytop
of the car market.
BMWhasastrongbalancesheet,withmore
than €30bn (£26.6bn) of net cash – roughly
equivalent to half of its market cap – in its
auto business, a conservatively capitalised
ﬁnancing business, a positive net working
capital position and a negligible pension
deﬁcit. It’s one of the best managed compa-
nies in the sector, in part due to the strong
alignment created by the Quandt family
owning around 45 per cent of the company.
Despite the attractive fundamentals,
BMW’s shares have often been out of favour.
Key concerns weighing on its share price
have been attributable to the threat of elec-
triﬁcation for legacy automakers brought on
by new economy competitors such as Tesla
(US:TSLA).
BMW is well placed to navigate the tran-
sition to electric vehicles. It invested early
and aggressively, spending more than ﬁve
years integrating electric vehicle technol-
ogy throughout its design and production
processes. Since then, BMW’s initial range
of electric vehicles has launched success-
fully and the company has one of the high-
estbatteryelectricvehiclepenetrationlevels
among the large incumbent automakers, at
about 10 per cent of vehicles sold in 2022.
BMW expects this ﬁgure to rise to about half
of sales by 2030. Electric vehicle margins at
productionscalehavegonefrombeingarisk
factor to being close to those of the internal
combustion engine equivalent for most of
BMW’s models.
That’snottosaythatBMWiswithoutrisk.
It’s a cyclical business and dependent to an
extent on China. The prospect of a reces-
sion in 2023 and/or worsening western rela-
tions with China would be negative for its
share price. But existential risks from new
economy competitors have eased. Tesla,
NIO (HK:9866) and Li Auto (HK:2015)
focus on models outside BMW’s niches, and
Lucid (US:LCID) and Rivian Automotive
(US:RIVN) risk suffering from a lack of
venture capital funding.
BMW’s future looks clearer than it has for
sometime.ButBMWistradingataround0.8
times its net asset value (NAV), not far from
its trough valuation during the most uncer-
tain days of the pandemic and well below a
more historically normal multiple of 1.0 to
1.2 times NAV.”
BMW was one of the Orbis Global Equity
fund’s 10 largest holdings at the end of
January, accounting for 2.4 per cent of its
assets.

SVB collapse could prefigure
tech M&A surge
We’re going to be hearing a lot about interest
rate sensitivity over the next couple of weeks.
The attempts by Silicon Valley Bank (SVB),
part of listed SVB Financial Group (US:SIVB),
to shore up its liquidity position are covered
elsewhereinInvestors’Chronicle,alongwiththe
consequentrunbydepositors.Marketanalysts
are now scrambling to determine any risk of
contagion within the hopelessly intertwined
network that is the global ﬁnancial system.
New York-based Signature Bank
(US:SBNY), with assets of $110bn (£91.7bn),
has already followed suit, while several
regional banking groups in the US have come
under the microscope, although the extent to
which any of these banks is exposed via the
interbank market is not immediately obvi-
ous. Closer to home, prices of credit default
swaps for some of Europe’s most at-risk
banks have been bubbling up, while euro-
zone bond yields headed south after inves-
tors rushed into safe-haven assets.

recently exacerbated by Congressional testi-

tiesandbondscouldsuﬀeranotheryearwhen
thetraditionalinverserelationshipdoesn’tplay
out, thereby rendering the traditional 60/40
split largely redundant.
The experience of SVB shows that a liquid-
ity issue can swiftly morph into a solvency
one. SVB wasn’t integrated within the inter-
bank market, nor was it weighed down by a
sea of derivatives where pricing often bore
little relationship to the value of the underly-
ingassets.Nonetheless,givenwhathappened
atLehmanBrothers,it’sslightlyironicthatan
absence of derivatives on the bank’s balance
sheet,speciﬁcallyhedgesagainstinterestrate

noting that the issue had less to do with inad-
equate capital requirements than it did with
a colossal surge of deposits generated by the
IPO/SPACboomin2020-21–apparentlythere
is such a thing as “surplus liquidity”.
Beyond avoiding financial institutions
whose cash management procedures do not
takeaccountofthelimitsofdepositinsurance,
it’s not immediately obvious what lessons we
cantakefromthecollapse.Somethingrelating
to‘moralhazard’perhaps?Whenevergovern-
ment–ergothetaxpayer–actsasbackstopon
private losses, corporations, their clients and
investors have less incentive to be cautious
with their capital if they blithely assume that
the government will step in and cover any
losses or liabilities – risk management strat-
egies (and price discovery) eﬀectively go out
the window.
Comparisons have been made with the
unwinding of SVB and the US Savings and
Loan crisis, when US taxpayers had to cover
the losses brought about by the collapse of
about one-third of the country’s savings
and loan associations during the 1980-
90s. However, the failure of Bear Stearns
in 2008 provides a more apt comparison.
Cause gave way to eﬀect as a faltering share
price triggered a wave of client redemptions,
further undermining Bear Stearns’ market
valuation, and so on – a cascading eﬀect all
too familiar to customers of SVB.
The problems at the bank also serve to
remind us how tech valuations became so
separatedfromthosegovernedbyfundamen-
tal analysis. Part of the blame might lie with
private equity ﬁrms and venture capitalists,
who – some might argue – were essentially
hitching rides on tech listings whose multi-
ples they helped to inﬂate.
A popular exit strategy for these types
of market participants was abruptly cut oﬀ
in 2022, as enthusiasm for public listings
waned in line with valuations. It’s conceiv-
able that listing on public markets could
become a slightly more desirable option for
tech companies now that a major source of
funding has been curtailed. After all, intan-
gible assets aren’t readily utilised as collat-
eral for ﬁnancing.
Just because valuations in tech markets
were so frothy over the past few years, it
doesn’t mean that you can’t determine the
intrinsic value of stocks within the sector,
even though the accounting treatment of
intangible assets poses an ever-greater chal-
lenge for investors. It is possible to look at
growth-focused tech stocks within a value
context. And you could even make the case
that stockpicking comes into its own when-
ever liquidity is withdrawn from markets.
The Nasdaq lost a third of its value during
2022 and any revival is unlikely to be driven
by a major step up in IPO activity. And with
SVB out of action and development capital
in short supply, we might reasonably expect
a pick-up in M&A activity across the broader
sector. For now, markets remain febrile, so
investors might be well advised to assess
which rate-sensitive areas of the economy
will be next to feel the pinch.

tion, rather than its income statement, and
the cover ratio came out at a healthy 212 per

The market’s generally positive reaction to
the results was partly down to adjusted oper-
ating proﬁts, which were 35 per cent higher
at £2.21bn – although it should be noted that
this is a management-generated ﬁgure and is
not compatible with IFRS. Still, management
seemed conﬁdent enough in the company’s
overall position to continue with its increas-
ingly large capital returns to shareholders.
A further £300mn of share buybacks were
announced alongside the results. The ﬂipside
to higher payouts is lower costs and, despite
inﬂationary pressures, controllable costs
fell by 3 per cent for the year to £2.77bn.
Management said the company was on track
to achieve its £750mn cost-saving target by
the end of next year.
The share buyback takes the company’s
total capital returns since 2021 to over £5bn
and represents the windfall from Aviva’s
various overseas business sell-oﬀs, as well
as pressure from activist investor Cevian
Capital to bump up payouts. , Cevian cut its
stake in Aviva to under 5 per cent prior to
these results after what is likely to be seen as
a successful activist holding for the Swedish
investor – with regards to payouts, at least.
Aviva hands more capital back to shareholders as Cevian steps back.

Volution FAN 404p
BUILDING MATERIALS: OTHER
A pleasant surprise for shareholders in
Volution (FAN) is how well its UK resi-
dential arm did. As peers such as Travis
Perkins (TPK) report a worsening of condi-
tions in the home improvement market,
the maker of air quality systems and heat
pumps reported a 16 per cent increase in UK
residential revenue, which helped to oﬀset
declines in commercial and export revenues.
Chief executive Ronnie George argued that
its air quality systems “are far less discre-
tionary” in nature than many products sold
by sector peers, especially for its social hous-
ing customers.
A coroners’ report attributing the death
of two-year-old Awaab Ishak in December
2020 to the damp and mould in the home
provided by Rochdale Boroughwide Housing
led to housing secretary Michael Gove writ-
ing to social housing providers in November
last year threatening to withhold funding to
those whose properties are not up to scratch.
Group-wide, Volution’s adjusted operat-
ing margin softened slightly, but at 21.1 per
cent remained above its 20 per cent target.
Its shares rose by 14 per cent, buoyed not
only by enduring demand but also comments
that inﬂationary and supply chain pressures
are easing.
The bounce means Volution’s shares are
up around 22 per cent since we changed our
recommendation to buy six months ago.
They now trade at 17 times FactSet’s consen-
sus forecast earnings, above their ﬁve-year
average of 14.6 times.
Strong cash generation is whittling
down its debt, though, “leaving scope for
£140mn spend on M&A” according to broker
Berenberg. With a “well-developed” pipe-
line, we expect more activity on this front
and maintain our buy stance. MF

CLS Holdings CLI 146p
REAL ESTATE HOLDING AND DEVELOPMENT
Like many of its peers, developer CLS
Holdings (CLI) swung to a loss in 2022 due
to the higher interest rate environment.
However, the oﬃce landlord, which owns
assets in the UK, Germany and France,
faces additional problems that its compet-
itors do not.
First, while there is arguably little a
landlord can do about a short-term port-
folio valuation drop in a wider real estate
market downturn, the fact that its net rental
income also dipped last year is a concern.
Many other real estate investment trusts
(Reits) – Tritax (BBOX), Unite Group
(UTG), Derwent London (DLN) and PHP
Properties(PHP) – posted chunky valuation
falls over the past few weeks in their results
for the last calendar year, but all of them
recorded an uptick in net rental income.
CLS’s comparatively worse performance is
duetotheamountofunletspaceinitsportfo-
liobyvaluegrowingto7.4percent.ForitsUK

These worrying trends are accompanied
by an increase in net debt to a level that is
much higher than other FTSE 350 Reits. The

value, but we feel this is justiﬁed considering

Deteriorating economic conditions led
SpirentCommunications’(SPT) customers
to pull back on spending in the second half
of 2022. Spirent’s order intake for the year
dropped 2 per cent to $623mn (£519mn) and
management now expects revenue for the
current year to fall.
When economic conditions weaken, tele-
communicationscompaniescutbackonspend-
ing which means less demand for Spirent’s
testing and assurance services. In the lifecycle
serviceassurancebusiness,revenueincreased
1.1 per cent for the full year. However, this
growth was weighted to the first half and
“customer purchasing decision delays in the
latter part of the year” meant adjusted oper-
ating proﬁt was down 19.2 per cent to $51mn.
Networks and security fared better – they
are not as closely linked to telecoms compa-
nies’ investment decisions. Adjusted operat-
ing proﬁt increased 36.7 per cent to $86.8mn
and a “refreshed portfolio” allowed Spirent
to take market share.

Spirent’s free cash ﬂow increased 12.9
per cent to $104mn which, on revenue of
$607mn, shows it is doing a good job of turn-
ing its work into dollars. We still think the
structural growth trends of 5G investment
will drive the business forward and 2023
will just be a temporary blip in a share price

Entain (ENT) got some bad news last
month.ThechiefexecutiveofMGMResorts
International (US:MGM), which had been
rumoured to be keen on making another bid
for the company after the eventual release of
the long-awaited UK gambling white paper,
conﬁrmed on an earnings call that the idea is
dead in the water. Bill Hornbuckle said on the
call that “it’s time to be deﬁnitive and give a
little direction. The simple answer on Entain
is no, we’ve moved on”.

ConvaTec CTEC 222p
MEDICAL SUPPLIES
ConvaTec’s (CTEC) products – from wound
dressings to cannulas – may not be novel, but
they are dependable from a sales perspec-
tive. Despite currency headwinds and cost
inﬂation, the company still managed modest
annual revenue growth in 2022.
The majority of its revenue (52 per cent)
is denominated in US dollars. However,
most of the other currencies that make up
ConveTec’s earnings depreciated against the
dollar throughout the year.
Adjusting for foreign exchange impacts
and activities related to the divestiture of its
hospital business, the company said revenue
grew 5.6 per cent on an organic basis.
Reported gross margin fell from 55.1 per
cent to 53.3 per cent year on year because
of the impact of inﬂation on raw materi-
als and freight prices. One-time divestiture
and termination costs also hit proﬁtability.
For the current year, ConvaTec expects to
record organic revenue growth of 4.5-6 per
cent, with much of this growth forecast to be
weighted toward the second half.
“Net finance costs of $70mn-$80mn
[£59mn-£68mn] may put some pressure
on EPS,” wrote Numis analysts in a research
note. The company’s net debt increased by
$187mn in 2022 after it acquired Triad Life
Sciences. Leverage reached 2.1 times, up
from 1.9 times in 2021. Management said it
would continue to target leverage of 2 times,
“but will be comfortable going up to c. 2.5
times for appropriate M&A opportunities”.

ings at a multiple of 20 times for the current
ﬁnancial year. Buy. JJ

Harbour Energy HBR 262p
OIL: CRUDE PRODUCERS
• Free cash flow triples to $2.1bn
• Management knocks down debt alongside
$400mn buyback scheme
H
arbour Energy (HBR) has revealed
a $2.45bn (£2.1bn) tax bill for 2022,
taking its post-tax proﬁt to $8mn on
sales of $5.4bn for the year. The company
has lobbied heavily for changes to the
government’s energy profits levy, which
was increased to 75 per cent on proﬁts in
November. Harbour boss Linda Cook said
the levy was having a signiﬁcant impact on
the business. “For Harbour, the UK’s largest
oil and gas producer, it has all but wiped out
our proﬁt for the year,” she said. “This has
driven us to reduce our UK investment and
staﬃng levels.”
The tax bill does bear some scrutiny,
however – for the 2022 calendar year, the
current tax expense is $706mn, including
$326mn in windfall tax. The lion’s share of
the $2.45bn is $1.5bn in a “one-oﬀnon-cash
deferred tax charge”, which comes from the
revaluation of tax losses that came from the
Premier Oil takeover, using the new 75 per
centtaxrateoutto2028.Actualtaxpayments
for the year came to $551mn, double the year
beforeonapre-taxproﬁtthatwaseighttimes
the previous year’s ﬁgure.
Outside the tax battle, Harbour’s year is
as expected – earnings surged on higher oil
and gas prices. Ebitdax, which is cash proﬁts
excluding $106mn in exploration spending,
rose almost two-thirds, while free cash ﬂow
tripled to $2.1bn.
Its hefty borrowings have also come down
signiﬁcantly, with $1.8bn paid oﬀits largest
debt facility, leaving net debt at $704mn,
excluding leases. On top of that reduction,
the company also spent $361mn on share
buybacks in 2022, with another $41mn of
shares repurchased so far this year.
Thecompanyhassaiditwouldmakeastra-
tegic shift away from growth in the North Sea
Non-cash charges related to previous tax losses mean a hefty
writedown for the North Sea oil and gas producer. Alex Hamer reports
Harbour Energy free cash
soars alongside tax bill
because of the higher UK taxes. Analysts say
new reserves must be found. Over the course
of 2022, Harbour’s reserves declined by 9 per
cent, with production and UK licence relin-
quishmentsoﬀsetbyexplorationinIndonesia.
“The biggest challenge [for Harbour] lies in
thefuture,andcentresonhowtoﬁxitsgrowth
problem as capex gets cut and production
decline sets in,” said Peel Hunt analysts in the
lead-up to the results announcement.
Cook and her management team said they
were open to buying new assets in Norway,
which has higher taxes than the UK, while
exploration in Indonesia has been stymied
by having a Russian partner on one of its
projects there.
Harbour is keen to outline just how tough
things are currently, but its free cash ﬁgures
and shareholder returns say otherwise. Its
medium-termprospectskeepuscircumspect,
however, even with the windfall tax discount
on its shares currently. Hold.

The pandemic wreaked havoc on Informa.
However, after multiple lockdowns, a
£1.1bn loss, and the suspension of divi-
dends, Informa (INF) is ﬁnally back in busi-
ness – and taking a new approach. Last year,
the events and publishing group sold oﬀits
Intelligence division for £2.5bn, and is now
in the pleasant position of deciding what to
do with the windfall.
Shareholders are in line for a few treats.
Informa has upped its share buyback scheme
from £725mn to £1bn, of which £589mn has
alreadybeenpaid.Managementisalsopredict-

More important, however, is the long-term
strategic direction of the group. Events are
nowapriority,andInformahasacquiredB2B

(£791mn). This is a gamble but seems to
make sense, given that trade shows and exhi-
bitions are in the process of recovering.

nue by 3 per cent in 2022. However, Informa
Tech, which provides market research for
the tech sector, looks more promising from
a growth perspective, with revenue expected
to exceed $500mn in 2023.
It’s clearly an important time for Informa,
and management is trying to tap into grow-
ing markets. Moreover, following last year’s
divestments, the company’s balance sheet is
very strong. It is still early days, though, and

• Takeover rumours spur new commitments
• Shares still yield highly
M
uch of the talk prior to these
results was related to specu-
lative bid rumours for hybrid
money manager M&G (MNG) as talk
swirled around the market that an immi-
nent hostile bid was in the works. Indeed,
the chief executive of Australian invest-
ment bank Macquarie, the object of suitor
rumours, went on the record to dismiss the
talk as “speculative”.
While that seems to be the case, it under-
lines the sometimes less than positive
impression that the direction and execution
of M&G’s growth strategy has made since it
was spun out from Prudential in 2019.
Those doubts go some way to explain-
ing why the company’s shares have been
consistently some of the highest yielding
on the market. The question that manage-
ment may have to answer is this: could
someone else do a better job?
In response, chief executive Andrea Rossi
seemed to make an impassioned appeal in
the results on behalf of the board. He spoke
of how M&G has “…a clear strategy to build
on the inherent strengths of our diﬀerenti-
ated business model. We will maintain our
ﬁnancial strength, simplify our business
and deliver proﬁtable growth”.
There were also additional targets set for
Shareholders may be tempted to sell to a bidder but the results
of its reorganisation have yet to play out. Julian Hofmann reports
M&G appeals for patience
the end of 2025 designed to maintain share-
holders’ collective interest, if not necessar-
ily to set hearts beating faster: to grow the
wealth management business to over 50 per
cent of operating proﬁt, to lower the group’s
leverage ratio to below 30 per cent – which
is the nominal value of its debt as a percent-
age of solvency II funds – something it last
managed in 2021, while generating £200mn
of cost savings over the same time span.
Operationally, the performance was
M&G’s usual curate’s egg. Client flows at
asset management were modestly lower
at £154mn, while average fee margins
were broadly stable at 32 basis points.
Improving the performance of its asset
management division is a priority, but
progress on that isn’t cheap – a combina-
tion of higher-than-expected costs and
general inflation increased the expense
ratio by 10 per cent to 77 per cent.
Making a clear judgement with M&G
is not easy as the usual havoc in the
reported numbers, caused by hedging
M&G’s solvency II position, means inves-
tors are reliant on management-generated
measures of performance. Even with bid
rumours supporting the share price, the
shares yield a forward dividend of 8.5 per
cent, with a consensus price/earnings ratio
for 2023 of 11. The reorganisation may still
yield fractionally better returns. Buy.

Admiral ADM 2,039p
PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE
The Association of British Insurers conﬁrmed
that the number of motor insurance claims
settled by insurers fell by 19 per cent in 2020.
The challenge for insurers was readjusting
premium rates in expectation that motorists
would eventually return to their vehicles.
These diﬃculties are reﬂected in full-year
ﬁgures for general insurer Admiral (ADM).
The fall-away in auto claims due to the
pandemic reversed through 2021-22, and the
resultant ﬁnancial drain was exacerbated by
inﬂationary eﬀects. Reported pre-tax proﬁts
fellbyathirddespitemanagement’sassertion
thatAdmiralhasimplemented“strongpricing
action to combat claims cost inﬂation”.
Outgoing chair Annette Court also pointed
to cyclical eﬀects, but the problems really
stemmed from the unwinding of unique
circumstances.
The group’s combined ratio – the sum of
incurred losses and expenses divided by
earned premium – increased to 101.7 per cent
from 85.2 per cent last time around. This was
accompanied by a deteriorating loss ratio.
Prices in the motor insurance segment are up
by a ﬁfth over the past 12 months. In all, net
insurance claims increased by 52 per cent.
Court rightfully points to the fact that
customer numbers are up 11 per cent to
9.28mn, and the group’s solvency remains
strong. FactSet consensus points to a
combined ratio of 90.5 in 2023 and a 25 per
centincreaseinreturnontangibleequity.The
dividend cut won’t help market sentiment,
but a prospective yield of 6.2 per cent looks
achievable, and a forward rating of 15 times
consensus isn’t too much to ask. Buy. MR

Hotel Chocolat HOTC 205p
AIM: FOOD PRODUCTS
The drop in revenue and proﬁt at luxury
chocolatier Hotel Chocolat (HOTC) high-
lights the strategic transition that the busi-
ness is going through.
In the key UK and Ireland market, reve-
nues were down 5 per cent to £127mn
despite “record” Christmas sales as online
sales fell and customers returned to stores.
International sales plummeted by 69 per
cent to just £2mn after the business ﬂed
from overseas markets such as the US due
to big losses.
This retrenchment has impacted the
shares, which have fallen by almost 50 per
cent over the past 12 months. The revised
overseas approach is, in the words of chief
executive Angus Thirlwell, “to pursue
the proven brand appeal with low-risk/
low-capex operating models”. There is a new
strategic partnership in Japan and plans are
under way for another shot at the US.
Gross margin fell by 200 basis points to
57.9 per cent despite higher prices, with
input cost increases and the erosion of full-
price sales having an impact. On the plus
side, management is bullish about getting
on top of operating costs, which were up 5
per cent year on year.
Peel Hunt analysts think that 2023 will
be a “nadir in performance terms” for Hotel
Chocolat. They added that “the growth pains
have left scars in sentiment and manage-
ment will need to rebuild faith. That is decid-
edly possible but the market will require
evidence before it truly re-rates the shares.”
Management thinks that it can hit a
20 per cent Ebitda margin in 2025, and has
announced 50 new store openings. With the
shares rated at a chunky 25 times forward
earnings according to the FactSet consen-
sus, we stay where we are. Hold. CA

• Operating profit up 14 per cent
• Margins under pressure
S
o far so good for recruitment company
PageGroup (PAGE), which is celebrat-
ing another record year. Operating
proﬁt rose by 14 per cent to £196mn in the
12 months to 31 December 2022, on the back
of 19 per cent revenue growth.
However, ﬁgures from the second half of
the year suggest storm clouds are gather-
ing. The group’s “conversion rate” – which
refers to operating proﬁt as a percentage of
gross proﬁt – dropped from 21.4 per cent
in the ﬁrst half to 15 per cent in the second
half, as a result of “more challenging trading
conditions’’ in the majority of its markets,
“together with the impact of Covid-19
restrictions in Greater China”.
The situation won’t have been helped by
the group’s large and expensive workforce.
PageGroupincreaseditsfeeearnerheadcount
by 861 in 2022, meaning there are now 9,020
consultants working at the group, compared
with 7,698 before the pandemic struck.
PageGroup knows better than anyone
that staff don’t come cheap these days,
and about three-quarters of its cost base is
employee related, including wages, bonuses,
share-based long-term incentives and train-
ing expenses. As a result, the hiring spree
pushed up PageGroup’s total administrative
expenses by almost 25 per cent to £880mn,
Conditions for the recruiter deteriorated in the second half of 2022.

and this coincided with a slowdown in
demand in the second half of the year.
PageGroup hasn’t been stung as badly as
Hays (HAYS), where high employee costs
caused operating proﬁt to fall in spite of
record fees. However, management said it
will reduce its headcount where the outlook
for growth or fee-earner productivity is
weak. It remains confident about some
areas of work, however, including technol-
ogy and healthcare and life sciences, and said
it “continues to see candidate shortages and
good levels of vacancies”.
There is very little detail about the outlook
for 2023 in PageGroup’s results. However,
management stressed that it could easily cut
costsduringadownturnduetothehighlevels

Meanwhile,someuncertaintyisalreadybuilt
into the price: PageGroup’s forward price/
earnings ratio sits at 15.1, below its ﬁve-year
average of 16.7, according to FactSet ﬁgures.
We remain circumspect, however. It has
been diﬃcult to second-guess the labour
market since Covid hit, and it is possible that
companies will keep hiring and workers will
keep moving. As the economic backdrop
darkens, however, this is far from guaran-
teed, and consensus forecasts suggest that
revenue and proﬁt will fall next year. Hold.

Hammerson HMSO 26p
RETAIL REITS
• Revenue falls
• Pre-tax profit narrows
D
isappointment best describes
the initial market reaction to
Hammerson’s (HMSO) full-year
results. Its shares fell 11 per cent on results
day and the company recorded another
pre-tax loss, albeit a smaller one than the
year before.
The loss before tax won’t have come as a
surprise to many investors. As higher inter-
est rates drag down property values, many
other FTSE 350 real estate investment
trusts (Reits) have posted losses for the
same reason. Statutory revenue of £131mn
was marginally down on the 2021 compara-
tor, but the shortfall was more pronounced
on a proportionately consolidated basis.
Gross rental income at £90.2mn was
broadly ﬂat on the prior year.
Hammerson blamed the revenue dip
on a fall in net rental income after it sold
some of its assets, and stressed that like-
for-like net rental income on the assets it
still holds is up, and that the overall occu-
pancy of its portfolio is up as well. “That’s
the point that I really want to empha-
sise,” chief executive Rita-Rose Gagné told
Investors’ Chronicle.
However, selling assets in order to grow
The retail landlord is narrowing its losses as asset values bottom out, but the
operational picture is not rosy. Mitchell Labiak reports
Hammerson slides
after revenue drop
revenue in a falling market is risky. Firstly,
while Gagné insists that the assets the
company has sold and wants to sell are
“good” and “attractive”, it is unlikely to get
yesterday’s prices for them. And, although
it says like-for-like rental income grew
over 2022, that was then. There are big
questions about whether it can increase
its rental income over the course of 2023
with the threat of a recession looming
overhead.
Debt also remains an issue for the busi-
ness. While it has reduced its net debt
figure, falling valuations and selling off
assets mean that its net debt as a propor-
tion of total equity is still high. This could
make financing future development tough
in a higher interest rate environment,
especially when the company is behind
many of its FTSE 350 Reit peers in terms
of redeveloping assets so that they can
hit tougher energy efficiency regulations
coming down the road.
The discount to net asset value may
make the price look appealing to inves-
tors, but paltry dividend payments less
so. What’s more, a price/earnings ratio of
13.7 times for the next two calendar years,
according to consensus forecasts from
FactSet, is not cheap enough for a company
where revenues are under pressure. Sell.

ou could argue that, since lockdown,
recruiters have been faced with an
unusual set of circumstances in global

to develop business plans in the face of an
ongoing skills mismatch, an early exodus of
near-retirees, fast-rising interest rates and
surging wage inﬂation. Throw in the conﬂict

farewelltoRobert Walters
eponymous chief executive, Robert Walters,
believes this blend of revenue streams repre-
sent “a clear strength and source of compet-
itive advantage and resilience when market
conditions become tougher”. That may be so,
but it’s probably telling that contract recruit-
ment activity increased in the latter part of
theyear.Naturally,companiestendtofavour
ﬁxed-term employment arrangements over

ties mount, and the group noted that several
market indicators deteriorated over the

A solid performance that was not dissimi-
lar in outlook to an earlier statutory release
from rival PageGroup (PAGE), yet it came
with news that Walters will retire from the
top post at the April annual meeting, passing
the reins to company insider Toby Fowlston.
He will retire at a point when conﬁdence
in the jobs market is beginning to wane,
not least because of the cutbacks we have
witnessed in the global tech segment. The
opposing tack is that China’s re-engagement
with the global economy will have a galvanis-
ing eﬀect. Whatever the outcome, a forward
rating of 10 times FactSet consensus earn-
ings isn’t prohibitive given a forward divi-
dend yield approaching 5 per cent, but it
would be folly to rule out a signiﬁcant dip in
net fee income in 2023. Hold.

that. In its last ﬁnancial year, Domino’sPizza

enterprise resource planning software.
The group’s investment in these assets was

driver was collection orders, which were up

PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE
• Deterioratingsolvencyratio
• Claimsoutstrippricingassumptions
A
s ﬂagged in January’s trading update,
Direct Line (DLG) will not be paying a
full-year dividend due to its deteriorat-
ing solvency ratio – a measure of the insurer’s
ability to meet its long-term ﬁnancial obliga-
tions. Rather than the resultant metric, it was
perhaps the degree of the fall – 29 percentage
points to 147 per cent – that caught the eye.
Themetric(post-dividendandsharebuyback)
fell towards the lower end of the risk-appetite
range,althoughit’sworthmentioningthatthe
ratio had increased by around ﬁve percentage
points by the end of February, partly due to
positivemovementsonthebondportfolio.The
reversal was driven by lower proﬁts, together
withlossesoninvestmentsheld,withthelatter
point of greater interest given current events
in the specialist banking sector.
Claims inﬂation has had an outsize impact
on the motor segment, where severity inﬂa-
tion was 14 per cent above the insurer’s
pricing assumptions. This not only points
to the underwriting challenge posed by the
return of regular motoring volumes as the
pandemic restrictions dissipated, but it also
reﬂects wider price pressures in the econ-
omy. Supply chain disruption fed through to
delays in third-party claims, so the cumula-
tive impact of these factors saw the segment’s
combined operating ratio – incurred losses
divided by earned premium – rise from 92.4
to 114.7 per cent year on year.
Management notes that pricing in the
insurer’s other business segments kept pace
with claims inﬂation, with combined operat-
ing ratios broadly in line with expectations,
albeitwhenthey’re“normalisedforweather”.
Indeed, Direct Line had to contend with
weather event claims of £149mn, more than
double the original budget assumption, with
thelion’ssharebroughtaboutbylengthyperi-
ods of sub-zero temperatures across Scotland
and North West England in December.
The insurer, in keeping with peers, has taken a bath on motor pricing
assumptions. Mark Robinson reports

PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS SUPPORT SERVICES
Shares in Costain (COST) have fallen by 90
per cent over a ﬁve-year period, hit by several
yearsoflossesonproblemcontracts.Itsperfor-
mance for 2022 was ahead of analysts’ expec-
tations, though, with revenue up by a quarter.
Although its adjusted operating margin
was ﬂat, fewer writedowns meant its stat-
utory operating margin grew from a nega-
tive 0.8 per cent to 2.5 per cent. And even
after paying £43.4mn to settle a contract
dispute, it generated net cash from opera-
tions of £16.7mn. Group chief executive Alex
Vaughan expects adjusted margins to keep
improving to 3.5 per cent over the next two
years and 4.5 per cent by 2025, driven by
“extensive changes” to its business prac-
tices. These include being more selective in
bidding and choosing to work only for “tier
one blue-chip customers”.
Robust infrastructure spending by govern-
ment and utility companies means there’s a
strong pipeline of work. Although its order
book at the end of last year was lower, at
£2.8bn, than the prior-year close of £3.4bn, it

Balfour Beatty BBY 350p
CONSTRUCTION
• Underlying profit up 42 per cent
• Heavily dependent on UK state contracts
F
ollowing Liz Truss’s disastrous ‘mini’
Budget late last year, government
ﬁnances were in such a state of disarray
thatthefutureearningspotentialofconstruc-
tion companies like Balfour Beatty (BBY),
who depend so much on state contracts,
looked in doubt. In its results for the last
calendar year, though, the company gave
investors some reasons to be hopeful.
First, it managed to widen its wafer-thin
margin from its underlying earnings-based
business from 2.3 per cent to 2.7 per cent. It’s
an incremental increase, but helped produce
a 42 per cent leap in underlying proﬁt.
Much of this came from improvement in
its UK construction arm speciﬁcally, which
swung from a £2mn underlying loss in
2021 to a £59mn underlying proﬁt last year
compared with broadly ﬂat ﬁgures for its US
and Hong Kong businesses. The company
put this down “increased volumes at HS2
and Hinkley Point C more than oﬀsetting
reduced regional volumes”.
This is where the bear case comes in: 91
per cent of its UK construction revenue last
year was from public sector and “regulated
industry clients”. The question is whether
that UK government gravy train will stay
on track.
On the one hand, the company has this
year been awarded a chunky £1.2bn govern-
ment road building at the Lower Thames
Crossing. What’s more, the company has
revenue streams beyond the UK to keep it
going, such as its $242mn (£200mn) road
improvement contract in North Carolina
and roughly HK$10bn (£1.06bn) worth of
projects from both the public and private
sectors in Hong Kong. This is probably the
reason why Peel Hunt believes the group will
continue to increase its revenues over the
next two years.
But even with Balfour Beatty’s overseas
The construction company had a good 2022, but the bear case remains the same.
Mitchell Labiak reports
Balfour widens proﬁt
margin but remains pricey
operations, the UK government is respon-
sible for a large chunk of its revenue
stream. As such, the threat of policymak-
ers dramatically pulling back on infrastruc-
ture spending remains a valid concern. Peel
Hunt’s forecasts give a forward rating of 11
times earnings. That’s pricier than some of
the construction group’s peers; given the
forward visibility we upgrade our rating for
this stock, but advise caution. Hold.

movements, making the income statement
diﬃcult to interpret – a life insurer’s primary

than protect the reported income statement
from wild asset swings. Therefore, the ﬁgures
require a certain amount of interpretation.
The IFRS adjusted operating proﬁt looked
more coherent at £1.25bn, which was ﬂat on
2021. At these levels, even small changes in
interest rates can have a positive impact, and
rising rates made themselves felt with inter-
est income generated by the company’s asset
base nearly £250mn higher at £2.88bn. This
included a third-party contribution from
related entities – interest income here rose
from £1mn to £21mn for the year.

Marshalls MSLH 290p
BUILDING MATERIALS: OTHER
In last week’s cover story on companies using
acquisitionsforgrowth,CenkosSecurities’head
of growth companies research Peter Renton
said one way of assessing whether a deal had
done well is to aggregate the cash proﬁt of the
acquirer and the target, then check back the
followingyeartoassesshowithadgrown.
LookingatMarshalls’(MSLH)resultseight
monthsafterits£535mnacquisitionofMarley,
theanswerisnotsowell–althoughadmittedly
it’s early days. The company said its revenue,
operatingproﬁtandearningspersharewereall
higher on an adjusted basis but this was after
some pretty hefty alterations.
Marshalls’ reported cash proﬁt in 2021
was £107mn and it acquired a business in
Marley that generated £49.5mn in the same
year. Even if you shave a third of that oﬀ
to account for eight months of ownership,
the cash proﬁt ﬁgure of £90.2mn for 2022
is disappointing. Basic EPS (on an enlarged
share base) fell by almost 60 per cent and
return on capital employed dropped to 6.4
per cent, from 20.6 per cent.
The issue is mainly Marshalls’ landscape
products arm (55 per cent of group revenue),
where sales and proﬁt were hit by declining
volumesinbothnewbuildandhomeimprove-
ment markets. The entire group has exposure
tothese,though,andvolumescontinuetofall–

Harworth HWG 117p
REAL ESTATE HOLDING & DEVELOPMENT
Harworth (HWG) saw its full-year pre-tax
proﬁt drop due to a valuation hit, as the
higher interest rate environment put pres-
sure on buyers’ budgets. But unlike, say,
some rivals in the real estate investment
trust (Reit) world, the industrial and resi-
dential developer’s top line was heading in
the right direction during 2022.
The reason for this is that while many of
Harworth’scompetitorsareReits,itfallsunder
adiﬀerentcategory.So,whilecompaniessuch
as Tritax Big Box Reit (BBOX) make money
from developing warehouse assets and rent-
ing them out, Harworth does this alongside a
separatebusinessofsellingdevelopmentland
to housebuilders. As such, it is not as vulner-
able to short-term asset revaluations and this
uniquemodelhasseenitoutperformtheFTSE
All-Share index since 2018 – and throughout
the property downturn.
Grossproﬁt,whichisitsrevenueminuscost
ofsalesbutbeforevaluationchanges,isup71.2
per cent, which the company put down to the
sale of a Kellingley development site for £54m
and “the acceleration of residential land sales,
particularlyduringtheﬁrsthalf,totakeadvan-
tageofthenbuoyantmarketconditions”.
Theotherdiﬀerentiatingfactorbetweenthe
Yorkshire-based company and its Reit rivals
is debt – or rather, the lack of it in Harworth’s
case. The last thing a company needs is an
overburdened balance sheet when interest
rates are on the rise. This should stand as an
encouraging sign for investors, along with the
39 per cent discount to estimated consensus
book value in 2023. Considering the compa-
ny’s underlying performance, we think this
represents good value. Buy. ML

T
here was a palpable sense of relief
in Prudential’s (PRU) results as the
Hong Kong-based and Asia-focused
life insurer seeks to beneﬁt from the general
openingofeconomicactivityafterChinalifted
most Covid-19 measures. Face-to-face meet-
ings are still an important selling strategy in
Asia and the company retains at least 5,000
agentsacrossitsdistributionchannels.Despite
thisheadwindlastyear,thecompanyreported
adjustedoperatingproﬁtof$3.37bn(£2.8bn),
up 8 per cent at constant currency.
The hedging complexity that character-
ises life insurance companies made itself
felt on new business lines. Proﬁts here at
constant currency were 11 per cent lower at
$2.18bn because of the impact of rising inter-
est rates on hedging positions – Prudential’s
primary goal being to defend the stability of
its Hong Kong-regulated group minimum
capital requirement. However, outside of
Hong Kong, new business performed better,
growing by 5 per cent to $1.8bn.
Drilling down into Prudential’s growth
markets showed why the company was so
keen to shift its strategic operations to Asia.
In countries such as Vietnam – which is
beneﬁting rapidly from a maturing economy
– Myanmar, the Philippines and Thailand,
proﬁt growth reached double ﬁgures, with
the 20 per cent growth in new-line business
easily the company’s strongest performance.
In IFRS terms, proﬁts within the segment
more than doubled to $881mn.
When it came to asset management, the
performance was more mixed. Prudential’s
Eastspring,likeeveryotherassetmanagerout
there, was hit by volatility in asset prices and
assets under management declined by 12 per
cent in constant currency terms to $221bn, as

BUILDING, ROOFING/WALLBOARD & PLUMBING
Joe Vorih, chief executive of Genuit (GEN),
saidthebuildingproductsgrouphaddelivered
“what I consider to be quite pleasing results”.
The fact that he had to qualify his statement
indicates that they were not. Although the
company pointed to growth in underlying
operating proﬁt and earnings per share, on
a statutory basis both measures experienced
double-digit declines.
Genuit had to contend with a number of
issues, including a cyber security breach and
chip shortages that hit its boilers business.
One-oﬀcosts of £40mn also included almost
£15mn of intangibles impairments and £9mn
of restructuring costs.
The former included writedowns of good-
will, as the company increased the discount
rate at which it valued future cash ﬂows by
250basispoints.“Wenowconsiderthematter
dealt with,” CFO Paul James said.
The latter is the result of Vorih’s plan set
out at its capital markets day in November
for a “lean transformation” of the business,
whichhesaidwilldeliverabout£8mnayearin
annual savings. Restructuring costs are likely
to remain elevated this year, though.
Genuit’s shares haven’t made the kind of
recovery that other companies in the build-
ing products market have, mainly because
of a proﬁt warning in October as volumes
fell due to weakness in the home improve-

Ferrexpo FXPO 126p
IRON & STEEL
• Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the dominant
factor in Ferrexpo’s performance
• Cash profits come in ahead of forecasts,
at $765mn
U
krainian iron ore miner Ferrexpo’s
(FXPO) 2022 results are not like
those of most other companies
listed in the UK. The standout figure, far
more than Ebitda or the final dividend,
is the 20 workers killed while defending
Ukraine from the Russian invasion. That
the company has been operating at all is a
significant result.
Since the war started last February, its
export capabilities have been severely
constrained, while the inconsistent
power supply has also cut the ability of
the company to turn the high-grade iron
ore it mines into pellets.
“Operationally, our assets have
produced in line with accessible markets,
with the closure of Ukraine’s access to the
Black Sea placing a significant impediment
in our ability to access seaborne markets,”
said company chair Lucio Genovese.
Exports to European customers contin-
ued, and the company kept total sales above
$1bn (£820mn), on pellet production of 6mn
tonnes, a 46 per cent drop on 2021. Sales
to Europe only fell 23 per cent, however, as
supply lines were more accessible.
There have been some positive updates
recently – Ferrexpo reported last month
it had restarted another pelletiser line,
meaning it is running at half capacity.
Ben Davis, an analyst at house broker
Liberum, said he was optimistic of an
agreement over iron ore exports being
made with Russia, akin to the grain corri-
dor deal. And failing that the “success of
Ukraine’s expected counter offensive in
the summer will ultimately lead to a with-
drawal of Russia’s navy from the Black
Sea”. Perhaps a forecast to be taken with
The iron ore miner has managed to reopen some production capacity,
and beat cash profit forecasts for 2022. Alex Hamer reports
Ferrexpo battles on
despite war challenges
a pinch of salt, however, given Liberum’s
experience is in equities research rather
than conflict strategy.
Amid the difficult operating conditions
(to put it mildly), there was a positive
surprise for shareholders in these results
– Ferrexpo managed to top consensus esti-
mates for cash profits of $730mn, with its
$765mn final figure. Liberum forecasts a
significant decline this year, however, to
$323mn. Alongside the war, global trading
conditions knocked earnings as the iron
ore price came down by around a quarter.
Ferrexpo also brings in a ‘pellet premium’
on top of the 65 per cent Fe market price,
and this climbed to $72 a tonne from $60
a tonne in 2021.
The company has had its usual corpo-
rate governance issues in the year – 49.5
per cent shareholder Kostyantin Zhevago
sells the company spare parts, insurance,
advertising and other services, racking up
$23mn in related party transactions in the
year. He quit the board in December after
being arrested in France on Ukrainian
charges.
We have previously recommended selling
Ferrexpo oﬀthe back of its ownership struc-
ture. Now the war is the determining factor
in its performance, and we are neutral given
the uncertainty there. Hold.

Close Brothers CBG 971p
BANKS
The market had been well prepared for Close
Brothers’ (CBG) scrappy half-year results
after the diversiﬁed ﬁnancial services group
disclosed large losses on its Novitas loan
book – Novitas was a legal services lender
that ﬁnanced litigation via intermediar-
ies that the company acquired in 2017. The
£90mn impairment charge Close Brothers
took on the loan book was the main reason
why reported proﬁts were so drastically
reduced. Management expects provisions to
adequately cover any further charges related
to Novitas as the loan book is run oﬀ.
The hybrid nature of Close Brothers bank-
ing/asset management/broking model can
make evaluating its overall performance
awkward. However, while the banking arm
suﬀered from the Novitas writedown, the
division’s net interest margin was margin-
ally higher at 8 per cent, aided by 14 basis
points of one-oﬀbeneﬁts generated by mark-
to-market swaps.
Meanwhile, the asset management busi-
ness saw positive net inﬂows of £474mn as
assets under management rose by 3 per cent
to £15.7bn. The company’s broking business
Winterﬂood is still in the doldrums and a
lack of deals meant operating proﬁts were
more than 70 per cent lower at £2.4mn.
Analysts at Panmure Gordon said in a
note: “at this stage in the cycle there should
be much to commend Close, but trust in the
model has inevitably taken a knock of late.”
The broker’s forecasts for 2023 are skewed
by impairments but these return to a more
realistic looking nine times EPS forecasts for
nextyear.Aperiodofstagnationfortheshare
price seems inevitable until Close Brothers
proves that there are no more skeletons in
the cupboard. On that basis, we downgrade
our recommendation. Hold. JH

The market’s reaction to insulation special-
ist SIG (SHI) declaring its ﬁrst pre-tax proﬁt
since 2018 was muted, to say the least (see
page 43).
The shares slid by 5 per cent on the day to
40p, leaving them ﬂat over the course of the
past year. Its current valuation of 13 times
earnings is well below its ﬁve-year average of
20.5 times, although this may not be the best
metric on which to value the company given
the meagre amounts of proﬁt that has been
squeezed out during that period. The same
could be said for cash ﬂows, although SIG has
been consciously spending more in a bid to
rebuild margins.
After tapping investors for £165mn in
2020 in a deal that saw private equity ﬁrm
Clayton, Dubilier & Rice take a 25 per cent
stake (now 29 per cent), SIG began rein-
vesting in its UK distribution network and
rehiring experienced managers who had
left the business.
Althoughithashadtocontendwithweaker
demand in the home improvement market,
it increased its operating margin last year to
2.9 per cent, from 1.8 per cent a year earlier.
Gavin Slark, who was appointed as chief
executive in February after nearly 12 years at
the helm of Dublin-based DIY group Grafton
(GFTU), reiterated a medium-term goal to
increase its operating margin to 5 per cent
“when markets recover”.
He bought £340,000 worth of shares last
week. Although he needs to build up his
shareholdingto300percentofhisbasesalary
(£675,000 on appointment, according to the
company’s annual report), he has ﬁve years
in which to do so.
SIG’s shares have rallied strongly since the
start of this year but still lag peers on most
metrics. Clearly, Slark sees an opportunity
in its recovery, but with dividend payouts on
hold until the balance sheet improves (net
debt is still 2.8 times cash proﬁt) others will
need more convincing. MF

Full-year results from private equity
investment company Oakley Capital
Investments (OCI: 471p) highlight why the
shares have delivered a 239 per cent total
return since I included them, at 146.5p, in
my 2016 Bargain Shares Portfolio. In fact,
an annualised net asset value (NAV) per
share return of 23.4 per cent over the past
five years makes Oakley the best-perform-
ing AIC investment company.
Two-thirds of last year’s portfolio valu-
ation uplift was driven by the 22 per cent
average growth in investee companies’ cash
profit. The balance of the uplift mainly
came from exits – five realisations gener-
ated £234mn of proceeds, equating to
an average 70 per cent premium to their
carrying value and a five times gross money
multiple. The average enterprise value to
cash profit multiple embedded in valua-
tions edged up from 15.3 to 15.9 times on a
weighted average basis.
Of course, the main reason for
the ongoing outperformance is the abil-
ity of Oakley’s astute investment team
to back the right type of company in
the first place across three core market
segments – technology, education and
digital consumer – and then shrewdly
make exits to bank handsome gains. The
majority of investments have defensive
characteristics, benefiting from strong
structural market growth, asset-light
business models and high cash conver-
sion rates. Around 70 per cent of portfolio
companies operate a subscription-based
model or recurring revenue business
model, so are less exposed to short-
term falls in customer demand; and
two-thirds of the portfolio deliver products
or services digitally.
House broker Liberum Capital believes
the portfolio mix and ongoing cash profit
growth support further mid-teens increases
in NAV per share to 767p (2023) and 877p
(2024), implying the shares trade on
unwarranted discounts of 38.6 per cent and
46.3 per cent, respectively. Buy.

Two small cap gems are upgrading
their earnings forecasts
Identifying companies in the early stage
of an earnings upgrade cycle can pay divi-
dends. That’s because earnings momentum
not only mitigates investment risk, but the
greater certainty of hitting or exceeding
forecasts can lead to multiple expansion.
Barnsley-based Billington (BILN:380p),
a leading structural steel and construction
safety solutions specialist, is a prime exam-
ple. Buoyed by a bumper order book, a more
proﬁtable revenue mix and sales pipeline,
house broker FinnCap upgraded its 2022
and 2023 earnings per share (EPS) esti-
mates by almost a third last September,
and by an eye-watering 50 and 55 per cent,
respectively, in mid-December. Last week’s
pre-close trading update has forced analysts
to push through further mid-teens EPS
upgrades for both years, based on pre-tax
proﬁt rising ﬁvefold to £6.6mn (2022) and
by a further 33 per cent to £8.8mn this year.
On this basis, expect EPS of 45.7p (2022)
and 57.1p (2023).
Moreover, net cash is surging, up from
£9.4mn (2021) to £11mn (91p) and is fore-
cast to rise to £15.4mn (27p) by the year-
end. So dividend guidance has been raised,
too. FinnCap pencils in a 2022 dividend per
share of 15.5p (41 per cent upgrade), rising
to 20p in the current year (54 per cent),
the latter underpinned by a 13 per cent free
cash ﬂow yield. Rated on a cash-adjusted
prospective price/earnings (PE) ratio of 5.1
and oﬀering a forward dividend yield of 5.3
per cent, the shares continue to rate a buy.

Having successfully integrated the business
after acquiring it in January 2022, PSK subse-
quently landed a $10mn contract with the
Israeli Ministry of Defence, its contribution
more than oﬀsetting the loss of earnings from
MTI’s Russian operations, which were sold in

on revenue of $17.3mn in 2023, adding that
their 5 per cent revenue growth assumption is
conservative.
Switching on antenna growth
MTI’s smaller antenna division has contract
momentum, too. Last autumn, the unit won
two contracts worth $1.25mn, including a 5G
backhaul award in India, and has a “big pipe-
line of contract opportunities”, says Borovitz.

Also, Mottech has expanded its service and

control more than 30 city fountains that had
previously been operated individually. There
is an opportunity to expand the deployment of

The ﬁrst-half proﬁt numbers from Litigation
Capital Management (LIT: 70p), a provider
of litigation financing that enables third
parties to pursue and recover funds from
legal claims, mask strong momentum across
the business.
Followingtheperiodend,anAustralianclass
action produced a A$5.8mn (£3.2mn) gross
proﬁt on the A$8.3mn capital LCM invested.
Moreover, the group had a successful outcome
on a claim against the former auditors, KPMG,
of Carillion. The A$9.1mn funding of the liti-
gation was ﬁnanced 75 per cent by LCM’s ﬁrst
Global Alternative Returns Fund (GARF) and
25percentbythegroup.BoththefundandLCM
madeagrossproﬁtofA$6.3mn,butthegroup’s
return was 2.78 times its capital invested, or
three times higher than the fund’s return.
The performance fee on the Carillion case
doubled LCM’s proﬁt on the case, highlighting
how managing third-party funds can leverage
its impressive track record and boost returns
for shareholders (IRR of 79 per cent on all
completed cases inclusive of losses since June
2010).Factoringinbothsettlements,pro-forma
adjusted operating profit would have been
A$6.3mn rather than a loss of A$5.5mn.
Strong pipeline of cases
awaiting judgement or award
Furthermore, the ﬁrst GARF provided liqui-
dation ﬁnance to a partner of FRP Advisory
(FRP), additional liquidator of the former
Comet Group to cover proceedings issued
in the High Court against Darty, a multina-
tional electrical retailer based in France. At
the time of its insolvency, Comet was the
UK’s second-largest electrical retailer with
239 stores and 6,900 employees.
The legal action relates to a transaction
that gave preference in Darty’s favour prior
to Comet entering administration, thus
reducing the amounts available for Comet’s
creditors. Last autumn, the High Court
awarded £110mn in the favour of the liqui-
dator. An appeal by Darty will be heard in
June or July with ﬁnal judgement around
three months later. The fund has invested
around £3.1mn to date in the case, so LCM
should be in line for another chunky perfor-
mance fee.
It’s worth pointing out that LCM’s total
assets under management have increased
from A$414mn to A$537mn (including
commitments in the second GARF) across
a well-diversiﬁed portfolio of more than 50

Fonix’s main activity is a mobile payments

customers’ mobile phone bills for products
or services, turning the mobile device into a
cash register while oﬀering convenience for
consumers. The payment platform is highly
scalable and acts as an important customer
acquisitiontoolforclients,too.That’sbecause
Fonix diﬀerentiates itself from traditional
payment methods, such as credit cards or
ApplePay, by oﬀering an alternative payment
method to consumers who may otherwise
forgo purchasing. The payment platform is

Since the period end, ITV has extended its
commercial partnership with Fonix to include
SMS billing payments, alongside the exist-
ing relationship for carrier billing and charity
services, across the ITV competition portal.
Over time Fonix will support all competition
interactivity for ITV’s on-air formats includ-
ing Dancing on Ice, Good Morning Britain, ITV
Sport, and Love Island. International growth is
a core investment strategy, too. Since launch-
ing services with Bauer Ireland, the group has
launched services with a second leading media
organisation and now aims to be the leading
payment partner for all broadcasters in the
region within 18 months.
Strong financial performance
In terms of divisional performance, Fonix’s
mobile payment segment increased gross
proﬁt contribution by 13 per cent to £6.6mn

used more as a sense check than a lead
metric for the purposes of valuation or
analysinganyonesetofresults.
All of which brings us, somewhat
circuitously, to this week’s US Cash
Magic screen.
The stockpicking method – a direct
adaptation of our successful and
long-running UK version – is designed
to search for S&P 500 companies
whose stated and forecast cash ﬂow
ﬁgures point to a good blend of busi-
nessqualityandcheapness.Itsinaugu-
ralappearancewaslastApril,meaning
ithasbeeninserviceforalittlelesstime

However, owing to an extended period
of leave later this year, I am expediting
the screen running list for now.
While events may change over the
comingmonth–particularlyifthepast
week’s market drama persists – the
goodnewsisthatthescreenperformed
remarkably well in its ﬁrst outing.
Theword‘remarkably’requiresabitof
context.Whilebothversionsofthescreen
(more on this below) outperformed the
S&P500byatleast10percentagepoints,
neither was that far into positive terri-
tory. But both the dispersion of returns
from last year’s 30 selections (half were
up on a total return basis) and the level
ofalphasuggesttomethatsignsofgrow-

at the forefront of investors’ minds for

also argue that those in the C-suite pay

bonusestendtobelinkedtoEPStargets.
Some outspoken investors, by
contrast, lean towards FCF. This is in
part because the cash ﬂow statement is
hardertomanipulateandgivesaclearer
picture of the cash left over for share-
holders after a company’s total growth
spending,interestcostsandotherover-
heads are factored in. Again, if one
were being cynical, you could say that
this results in an overly narrow view of
company performance and direction

Analysts, nominally tasked with
interpreting the former group for the
beneﬁt of the latter, sit somewhere in
between, although in my experience,
they often prefer EPS for two reasons.

April, it wasn’t until the rebound from
October’s market lows that solid free
cash ﬂow became a must-have attrib-
ute. Another way of looking at this is
thatvaluestocks,particularlyinsectors
whose cyclicality has proved less sensi-
tivethanfeared,haveheldupwell.
“Intheshortrun,”BenjaminGraham
famously said, “the market is a voting
machine but in the long run, it is a
weighing machine”. What the noted
value investor meant by this is that a
company’sactuallong-termcashgener-
ation, rather than the prevailing inves-
toroptimismorsentimentaboutthose
cash ﬂows, ultimately determines the
value of its shares.
Over the past 18 months, we have
witnessed something akin to a reversal
ofthislogic,aswildspeculationandopti-
mismaboutthefuturehasgivenwayto
themagneticpullofhigherinterestrates
andtoughertradingconditions.Asbusi-
nesses’capitalcostsandattendantrisks
have climbed, markets have been more
urgentintheirdemandtoseethemoney.
If the US Cash Magic screen is reﬂec-
tive of this pivot – and the past year’s
evidence suggests it might be – then oil
and gas stocks could once again be in
favour.Thirteenofthisyear’sselections,
from regional drillers to supermajors,
hail from the energy sector, compared
with just four in 2022. None trade on
more than 10 times forward earnings,
suggestinglittleinthewayofbullishness
aboutsustainedproﬁtabilityintheyears
ahead.However,mostalsoboastdouble-
digit forecast FCF yields, pointing to
some optimism that last year’s strong
cashgenerationwillcontinuein2023.
Myopicasthatimpliedoutlookmight
prove, it seems ﬁtting both for today’s
market conditions and a hypothetical
portfoliowhoseconstituentsarereshuf-
ﬂed once a year.
The methodology
Our Cash Magic screens combine
three hallmarks of value, quality
and momentum investing.
In the US version, all S&P 500
constituents are ranked by forecast
next 12-month FCF yield (FCF per
share as a percentage of share price).
They are separately ranked by cash
return on capital invested (CROCI).
This ratio, originally developed by
Deutsche Bank analysts in the 1990s,
measures how much FCF a company
produced for every dollar of capital
employed over the past year. The two
rankings are added together into a
combined score, which gives a ﬁnal
ranking.
For the ranked version of the
screen, the top 30 stocks are selected.
Stocks whose three-month share price
momentum exceeds the index median
are also highlighted and will be sepa-
rately tracked over the coming year.
This allows us to add a ‘run-your-win-
ners’ factor to the results.
The stocks selected by this year’s
screen can be found above.

H
edge funds are some of ﬁnance’s most
fascinatingbeasts.Forone,theirstrate-
gic diversity makes for a broad church.
Portfolios range from the esoteric (think
trades based on satellite images of ports, or
bonds’ legal ﬁne print) to long-only equity
mandates (ordinarily, FTSE 100 constituent
Pershing Square (PSH)). What they share is
an ability to convince sophisticated investors
to commit their cash for years, and a reputa-
tion for attracting some of the sharpest minds
inﬁnance,whoarepaidmegabuckstocookup
trades no-one else has thought of.
That ﬁnal quality makes them a good topic
of discussion for an ideas-focused investment
magazine.Andyetwerarelywriteaboutthem.
One reason for this is transparency. Because
they are usually private, hedge funds aren’t
subjecttothesamedisclosurerequirementsas
investment trusts or listed equity funds. Some
share their insights with investors, and some
dothisregularly.Butinaworldwhereinforma-
tional edge and trading secrecy is everything,
talking a lot isn’t always a smart move.
Another reason hedge funds’ trades can be
oflimitedvaluetoretailinvestorsiswhatthey
involve. Although the sector regularly deals
in liquid markets, hedgies’ edge is often found
in the corners of markets where illiquidity or
informational asymmetries create uncorre-
lated, outsized or positively skewed returns.
If you lack the ability to make said trades then
copy-trading simply isn’t an option.
These dynamics are exempliﬁed in what is
the biggest and most successful hedge fund
today, Citadel LLC. Last year, a series of enor-
mously successful bets catapulted the already
enormously successful Miami-based ﬁrm to
the top of the list of largest hedge funds in the
world by assets.
Precisely what those bets consisted of is not
known. Reportedly, even Citadel investors
have little idea of the trades that have helped
the ﬁrm’s ﬂagship multi-strategy fund deliver
annualisednetreturnsof19percentsince1990.
Whatwedoknowisthattheassetsitdealsin
– such as the convertible bonds that its found-
er-owner Ken Griﬃn traded from his college
dormroom–canbeoutofDIYinvestors’reach.
Andyetthereisonemarketwhereanyonecan
peer above the Citadel walls for a near-real-
time view of one source of the group’s trades:
shorts in UK equities.
Under FCA rules, investors must disclose
any short position equal to at least 0.5 per
cent of a company’s market value. The regu-
lator then makes these details public. Citadel,
which currently has 21 short positions across
18 companies, is one of the City’s most proliﬁc
short traders. It has generated dozens of
short ideas over the years, many of which are
mirrored across its funds.
Some very rough data-crunching reveals a
fewpointsofinterest.Atthepointofdisclosure,
the average position is £17.2mn. By the time
a position is closed out – deﬁned as the point
at which it dips back below 0.5 per cent value
which take 425 days on average – Citadel is up
between 4.1 and 4.8 per cent, depending on
how those trades are weighted. Although they
are fewer in number, trades that last between
oneandthreeyearstendtoperformalotbetter
and compensate for the fact that the majority
of trades appear to go against Citadel.
However, the data omits more than it tells.
Some of these short positions might be paired
with other long or short trades or used in arbi-
trage, complicating an assessment of them as
standalone ideas.
Tryingtotrackthetrades’successisparticu-
larly diﬃcult. The disclosure of a short posi-
tiondoesnotmeanitisanewidea(orthatitis
closed out if the position dips back below the
disclosurethreshold),andanypricemovement
fails to account for borrowing or margin costs.
All of which is to say that shorting is very
hard to get right, even for the world’s smartest
hedgefund.Proﬁtablycopyingitstrades,while
working with limited information, is probably
even harder. AN

L
astweek’srunonSiliconValleyBank
evokedpowerful,awfulmemoriesof
the 2008 banking crisis. The cata-
lysts – poor balance sheet manage-
ment, asset concentration and a
cavalier approach to risk – shared plenty
of parallels with the global ﬁnancial crisis’s
worst moments, while the swift action of
government and regulators to seize the
bank’s assets and ensure that deposits were
protected unambiguously was a sign that
lessons learned in 2008-09 were applied
quickly to stop the threat of contagion.
While the source of black swan events can
never be predicted, it’s always worth remem-
bering that the US ﬁnancial system’s impor-
tance makes it a likely vector. Depositors and
investors have also had to relearn an impor-
tant and brutal lesson: historically, bank
failures are commonplace. The US alone
accounted for an average of two collapses a
month between 2011 and 2020. In a digital
age, they might even be more likely to occur.
While queues snaking around branches
remain the go-to visual symbol of the bank
run,nowadaystheubiquityofonlinebanking
means the withdrawal of funds at the click of
button can precipitate a much faster collapse
than was previously physically possible.
As depressing as that may seem, invest-
ing in the sector still relies on understand-
ing the market. The US is a vast banking
market with a huge variation in regional
and national names, functions and levels
of regulation across a country the size of a
continent. The EU and UK equivalents, by
contrast, are more concentrated and typiﬁed
by large, tightly regulated deposit-taking
institutions with prudential regulations that
emphasise risk and balance sheet manage-
ment. Holding 14 per cent of the balance
sheet in cash, on average, is a huge safety
cushion for the UK’s high-street banks.
You’d struggle to see this from recent senti-
mentandpriceaction.SincetheSVBcrisissent
contagion fears rippling through the stocks of
global ﬁnancial ﬁrms, the Euro Stoxx Banks
Index has been hit hard, falling 15 per cent
below the ﬁve-year high reached on 6 March.
For investors who smell an opportunity
in the recent sell-oﬀ– but who don’t want
to commit their eggs to one basket – a euro-
zone bank sector exchange traded fund
(ETF) might be worth considering. As well
as oﬀering the comfort of diversiﬁcation, UK
investors can get exposure to the breadth,
strengths and sound prudential regula-
tion of Europe’s largest lenders without the
hassle of directly holding foreign shares (the
paperwork around withholding taxes can be
complex). To this end, the Lyxor Eurostoxx
Banks Ucits ETF (BNKE) may oﬀer a more

of 2023 and then stay there. Paradoxically,

in the short term as this can be handed on in
higher loan margins. A few weeks before the
recent drama, analysts at Berenberg pointed
to an implied cost of equity of more than 15
per cent for European banks, a level that has
prefaced a 40 per cent one-year sector rally
on four occasions since 1990.
The key variable in the coming months is

A big fear with the ECB’s experiments with

yield-hungry investors toward riskier assets.

While bank capital rules prevent European
banks from using risky assets in their collat-
eral, changes in the risk proﬁle and yields of
government bonds – which are admitted as
valid forms of capital – could be of concern.
This is because, as happened in the case of
SVB,risinginterestrateshaveservedtoreduce
themark-to-marketvalueofgovernmentbonds.
Given the choice between holding low-yielding
long-termbondstomaturityandcashorshort-
dated debt, capital allocators the world over
have dived into the latter. As the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development
has previously noted, the full impact of rising
governmentbondyieldsisalso“aprioriambig-
uous, depending on the size, structure and
maturity of total bank balance sheets and
the extent of hedging in a specific macro-
economicscenario”.
The other negative for banks is the higher
costs this means for issuing debt or attracting
new deposits. The risk of this should be oﬀset
by higher interest rate income, but treasury
management will become more complex as
banks look for diverse forms of funding, such
as preference shares.
Boring is better
US tech’s three-year boom to bust odys-
sey has been largely portrayed as an equity
market story. However, this obscured how
much money had been shovelled into the
sector to stoke the boom in the ﬁrst place.
It is therefore unsurprising that the retreat
of capital market funding for the sector has
been a proxy cause of the downfall of three
of the banks most closely tied to this cycle:
SVB, Signature Bank and Silvergate.
But it is important to remember that poor
asset and ﬁnancial management played a big
role in destabilising these US institutions.
Thisshouldnotobscurethefactthatforthe
ﬁrst time in 15 years, eurozone banks are net
beneﬁciaries of monetary policy.
The sector, with its focus on retail
customer deposits and lending in the mort-
gage market, has started to outperform US
rivals both in terms of share price gains
and interest rate margins, as lenders across
the Atlantic have seen an implosion in the
deal-making and investment banking fees
on which they are much more reliant.
Before the start of this year, investors
could see that the big retail banks’ earn-
ings and margins were set to climb. While
the SVB saga has obscured the immediate
outlook, the fundamental facts have not
changed for Europe’s financial institutions,

which is why the logic of buying a diversi-
fied product that follows the trend could
be a decent long-term buy.

more than eight times forward earnings,
BNKE represents a basket of reasonably

show resilience as the year progresses.
After the flash crash, investors should
expect to see a relief rally.

Keywords Studios KWS 2,726p
AIM: ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT
• Consistently beats guidance
• Exposed to long-term growth industry
• Strong cash generation
• Scale means an economic moat
K
eywords Studios (KWS) last
appeared in our ideas section in
January last year. At the time, we
arguedthatthevideogamesservice
company oﬀered exposure to the
fast-growing gaming industry without the
development risk of the video games studios.
Sincethen,eventshaveonlyreassuredusthat
this is the case.
In 2022, the gaming industry – like many
sectors boosted by the pandemic – went
through its own recession. Industry analyst
New Zoo estimated that the size of the total
market contracted for the ﬁrst time in its
historylastyear,falling4.3percentto$184bn
(£152bn).Thisdropshouldbesetagainstthe
34 per cent growth between 2019 and 2021,
but has still been a shock for an industry that
grew consistently over the past decade.
However, despite the wider videogames
industry shrinking, Keywords managed to
grow organic revenue by 21.8 per cent, an
acceleration from 19 per cent in 2021. As
a provider of services to the industry, the
popularity of any one game doesn’t aﬀect
Keywords’ performance directly because
revenue isn’t dependent on the ﬁnal release.
All that matters is that a lot of games are
produced, which is why we have previously
described Keywords as a picks-and-shov-
els play, in the tradition of those businesses
thatmadetheirmoneysellingtoolstominers
during California’s gold rush, rather than
doing the speculative digging.
Last year’s growth was also well ahead of
what the company initially expected. As late
as November, management had been guiding
for full-year organic revenue growth of over
10 per cent in November, but by January it
was conﬁrmed it would climb a ﬁfth. Foreign
exchange swings may have helped, but a
management team that underpromises and
overdelivers is much better than the other
way around. Neither is it only management
that underestimates its prospects: for much
ofthepastdecade,full-yearreportedearnings
per share have consistently beaten analysts’
guidance. When 2022 ﬁgures were released
thisweek,theyexceededconsensusforecasts
by 3.2 per cent, despite a steady stream of
upgrades over the past year.
Size is a plus
A strength and weakness of Keywords is its
scale. It has made more than 60 acquisi-
tions and spent almost €600mn (£527mn)
since 2014. These companies have also been
acquired across the world, making Keywords
a global business, and enabling it to service
the largest games studios on every continent.
It works with 23 of the top 25 largest game
developers,includingwell-establishednames
such as Electronic Arts (US:EA), Google
Alphabet (US:GOOGL), Netﬂix (US:NFLX),
Apple(US:AAPL),Microsoft(US:MSFT)and
Tencent (HK:700). None of its competitors
can do this in the same way.
However, acquisitions always bring risks
and merging all these businesses together
eﬃciently is easier said than done. Over
the past two years, bolt-on deals and
transaction-related foreign exchange move-
ments have contributed to an 87 per cent rise
in goodwill assets, to €397mn. A drop in the
pre-tax discount rate used to assess goodwill
value – from 12.5 to 10 per cent and reﬂect-
ing the group’s lower weighted average cost
of capital – also helped. This creates plenty
of opportunity for impairments if the consol-
idation is executed poorly, or acquired busi-
nesses fall short of management’s central
medium-term growth rate assumption of
10 per cent.
It’s a risk that has been noted by Matt
Tonge, a fund manager at small-cap asset
manager Liontrust’s Economic Advantage
Team.However,hehasseenanimprovement
in the past few years. “On a capital markets
dayafewyearsagosomeoftheacquiredbusi-
nesses referred to themselves as ‘I’, but there
seems to have been a shift recently towards a
more streamlined business.”
The shift Tonge refers to relates to the
‘One Keywords’ initiative, launched last year,
whichseekstopreservethegroup’sgeograph-
ically diverse and entrepreneurial culture
whileconsolidatingallservicesintothreedivi-
sions: create, globalise and engage.
Developers know Keywords can deal with
everyaspectofagame’sinternationallaunch.
The create division, which combines art
services and game development, helps with
the design of the game. The globalise arm,
which brings together audio, testing and
localisation, makes sure there are no bugs
in a game and translates it for international
release. Finally, the engage team deals with
all the marketing and PR around a launch.
Having employees across the world allows
Keywords to oﬀer 24-hour service and to
arbitrage cheaper sources of labour on behalf
of developers, such as ﬁnding game design-
ers in India to carry out design work for a
US customer.
Technology boosts productivity
Numis believes Keywords’ recent spate of
technology company acquisitions will boost
productivity once they are bedded in.
Helpshift,whichwasacquiredfor$75mnin
December, develops software that Keywords
hopeswillimprovecustomersupport,includ-
ing an AI chatbot. Dublin-based KantanAI,
formerly known as KantanMT and bought
in 2019, is a machine-learning translation
platform that enables Keywords to quickly
translate games into multiple languages. The
platform has allowed Keywords to develop a
workﬂowsystemwithMicrosoftthatbrought
Despite recent sector struggles, the gaming services provider’s

the localisation processing time down from
13 hours to 43 minutes. Mobile development
group Mighty Games, also acquired last year,
uses AI to test the games, which would be an
improvement on the hundreds of gamers it
employs to do this currently.
“You can see the logic of these acquisi-
tions and as the company scales we could
see margin expansion as these technologies
can be applied to more pieces of work,” says
Tonge. What is clear, from the group’s cash
ﬂow statement, is that it remains highly cash
generativeevenaftercapitalexpenditureand
M&A is accounted for.
The breathless hype around AI, espe-
cially since OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in
December, means investors should be wary
of any company’s claims for the technology.
However, the Helpshift deal shows Keywords
has been ahead of the curve when it comes to
identifying AI’s practical use cases. Whether
the company has overpaid for this exposure
remainstobeseen,althoughKantanAI’sabil-
itytostreamlinetranslationserviceslooksset
to drive growth and could prove invaluable.
Asiaisthefastest-growingmarketforNetﬂix,
and US content producers are targeting it as a
future growth driver.
This year will be slower
Although Keywords’ revenue isn’t as volatile
as that of the gaming developers it services,
it is not completely disconnected from the
fate of the wider market. After a down year
for the industry, developers are expecting to
cut back on spending and Keywords is fore-
casting 10 per cent organic growth. It is also
expecting adjusted proﬁt to drop from 17 per
cent towards the historical average of around
15 per cent, which the company has pinned
on rising labour costs and travel expenses.
Numis has assumed these growth rates and
margins will persist into 2024, resulting in
adjusted earnings of €1.22 per share this year
and€1.35in2024.Thatpitchesthesharesonto
an expensive looking price/earnings multi-
ple of just under 25 for the next 12 months.
However, this is below the ﬁve-year average
of around 33, per FactSet, and we believe the
growth last year in the face of economic head-
winds is evidence of its robustness.
The gaming industry may be slowing from
the pandemic peak. But that was an excep-
tionalyearandtheindustryisalmostguaran-
teed to carry on growing given its popularity
among the younger generations. Keywords’
growth-oriented strategy means it can proﬁt
without the scary bumps in the road.

OPINION
F
ear is engendered not so
much by the danger in plain
sight but by what we cannot
see; the danger we have to
imagine, the danger we’re
often all too eager to find. What
applies so well to horror movies also
works for ﬁnancial markets.
So, yes, it matters when the 16th
biggest bank in the world’s biggest
economy fails. After all, measured by
thebookvalueofitsassets,thefailureof
SiliconValleyBank(SVB)isthesecond
biggest in US banking history (though
almost certainly not if the compar-
ison were made with inflation-ad-
justed values). In nominal terms, it
hasbeenexceededonlybythecollapse
of Washington Mutual back in 2008,
just days after the demise of Lehman

2022 – just as its balance sheet was

a ﬁfth of the size of Lloyds Banking

UK’s ‘Big Four’ banks. Besides, the
speed with which banking authorities
bothintheUSandtheUKwereableto
shunt SVB’s assets and liabilities into
alternative arrangements implies the
crisis was over almost as it started.
Except that the fear factor says
there is never just one cockroach in
the kitchen. So another version of the
tomfoolery that SVB’s bosses got up
to with US government bonds is just
waiting to crawl out of another crack,
be it at Great Falls Trust & Savings of
Montana,theNationalTrustCompany
of Wichita or wherever (those names
are ﬁctitious, by the way).

Markets are quick to get spooked and regulators are over-indulgent

stances or is it just taking sensible
precautions? Depends. It is panicking
to shout ‘ﬁre’ then dash for the exit,
fallingdownthestairsinthecrush.It’s
notnecessarilypanickingtobeamong
the ﬁrst to take an early exit without
arousing alarm. In investing – as in
much of life – timing matters.
Sure, the fallout from SVB probably
won’t be like this. After all, from one
viewpoint all that has happened is the
collapseofamid-sizedbankwithabad
business model. So its failure is just a

ist system. In real life, however, things
are rarely that clear-cut and ﬁnancial

On one level that is the worst that

True, as Table 1 shows, the Nasdaq
index has had a bit of a shake-out
over the past 12 months. The only
index among those shown which has
performed worse is the FTSE Aim
All-Share, which brings us to this
week’s other subject – a one-year
review of a portfolio quickly put
together to test the idea that London’s
junior market could sustain an
income investor’s needs (‘Aiming for
income’, IC, 11 March 2022).
AsTable2shows,onthefaceofitthis
is not a silly notion. Only one in four
of the 727 companies quoted on Aim
is forecast to pay a dividend in 2023.

high-yieldportfolio.Granted,dividend
cover looks thin, but that was also the
case a year ago yet a portfolio was put
togetherthatgeneratedayieldofabout
5 per cent on cost.
The result, as Table 3 shows, is both
satisfactory and unsatisfactory. The
16-stock portfolio returned a 2.5 per
cent loss on capital values assuming
an equal weighting for each holding.
No great shakes compared with the 7
per cent return for the FTSE All-Share
index, yet commendable compared
with the 15 per cent loss from the
Aim All-Share. Dividends come to
the rescue to an extent. The portfo-
lio’s loss on capital values becomes a
total return of 3.2 per cent, almost 17
percentage points better than the Aim
All-Share total return.
Individual returns are distributed
fairly symmetrically among the 16,
though by far the biggest winner is
what was surely the portfolio’s riskiest
stock – Kazakhstan cement producer
Steppe Cement (STCM). A year ago
its forecast dividend yield was 19 per
cent, which says it all about the risks.
“Only the bravest investor would put
its shares into an Aim income port-
folio,” I wrote at the time. Bearbull
certainly isn’t the bravest, but risks
and rewards must go together some-
times; as they also did with the port-
folio’s second-best performer, another
Kazakhstan-based company, copper
miner Central Asia Metals (CAML).
Meanwhile, poor performance was
biased towards some of the portfo-
lio’s best established companies; in
particular, ﬂoorings supplier James
Halstead (JHD) and warehouses
landlord Warehouse Reit (WHR).
True, a long-term upward trend in
interest rates would further damage
Warehouse Reit. Even so, the pres-
ence of grown-up stocks such as those
in the portfolio – plus the likes of
MP Evans (MPE) and Polar Capital
(POLR) – means it is worth persisting
with the notion of Aim as the source
of income; but not to the extent of
selecting a new portfolio. This one
will do for another year.

D Pharma was full of promise,
with a terriﬁc idea: to harness
the live bacteria we all have in
our intestines to help tackle a range
of diseases in other parts of the body.
Soon after the group ﬂoated on Aim in
2014, its share price tripled.
This is just the sort of investment
that ethical investors look for, espe-
cially since 4D Pharma’s proposed
remedies seemed safe because they
came from bacteria derived from
humans. Its ﬁve clinical programmes
entered either phase I or phase II
stages (relating to solid tumours,
cancers and asthma) and a sixth
called Blautix (for irritable bowel
syndrome) went on to complete a
successful stage II trial. It collabo-
rated with Merck & Co (US:MRK)
on research to develop vaccines, and
with Parkinson’s UK and the Michael
J Fox Foundation on pre-clinical
programmes that targeted central
nervous system disorders. It had
others tackling cancer and auto-
immune diseases. Neil Woodford
invested. He was, he said, “fascinated
by the opportunity for innovation in
this sector to not only beneﬁt soci-
ety, but to deliver great returns to
shareholders”.
The directors, and especially the
two founders, Duncan Peyton and
Alex Stevenson, invested their own
money, but companies at this early
stage rip through cash, and ﬁnanc-
ing is a constant juggling act. In
early 2021, 4D Pharma received
cash of about $15mn (£0.82mn)
from a US special purpose acquisi-
tion company (Spac) that gave it a
secondary listing on Nasdaq. Merck
also took part in a share place-
ment for $25mn (£21mn). In July
2021, a senior secured credit facil-
ity was agreed with Oxford Finance
LLC, who said it knew life sciences
and healthcare “intimately well”
and that since 2002 it had funded a
range of companies with over $9bn,
providing “credit facilities ranging
from $5mn to $200mn”. It initially
lent 4D Pharma a relatively modest
$12.5mn, which Peyton said would
extend “our cash runway into Q4
2022”. Until September 2023, only
interest had to be paid, and then if
certain milestones were achieved,
another $17.5mn could be borrowed
and the interest-only period would
be extended to September 2024.
Bombshell
The shock came on 24 June 2022.
The group’s shares were suspended
from Aim at 12.30pm and, six hours
later, the directors explained why.
Oxford had bound 4D Pharma with
“customary restrictive covenants”
that required either more money to
be raised or a cash ﬂoat of $7.5mn to
be kept. Peyton said that “signiﬁcant
progress had been made, despite
the very diﬃcult prevailing market
conditions. The board had made
Oxford aware of this and discussed
a potential funding alternative on
the evening of 23 June”. Yet: “On
the morning of 24 June, Oxford
demanded immediate repayment of
the outstanding loans made to the
company” of about £11mn.
That placed the directors in an
impossible position. The group
hadn’t the cash. It was now insol-
vent. Suspension was the only option.
The same afternoon, Oxford Finance
placed 4D Pharma in administration.
Nasdaq delisted it on 7 July.
Oxford then seems to have sold
its loan to Armistice Capital Master
Fund. This was in October. The previ-
ous month, this New York hedge fund
had been taken to court, accused of
“systematically looting” the assets of
another company (Aytu BioPharma).
After Armistice had acquired all of 4D
Pharma’s secured debt, the adminis-
trators began negotiating a debt-for-
equity swap.
Shareholders agreed to this on 16
January this year, when they voted for
new shares to be issued to Armistice
for $15mn so that 4D Pharma could
return to Aim. Once again, they were
to be let down. A month later, their
shares were cancelled. Shareholders
now learned that two weeks earlier,
on 31 January, Armistice had chosen
not to provide the cash after all. 4D
Pharma was trapped in adminis-
tration. There was no way back for
the shares, so to pay oﬀthe debt the
administrators had now to sell oﬀ
the group piecemeal. Armistice has

a reputation for making, in its own
words, “concentrated bets to generate
uncorrelated returns”. It’s certainly
done that.
Lessons for the future
So what went wrong? Investing in any
company carries risks, and here was
the worst-case scenario: shareholders
lost every penny of their investment.
The idea behind Aim is to allow small
companies to thrive, so its bureau-
cracy is less onerous than on the
main market. The ﬂipside is that Aim
companies are more of a risk because
the corporate governance (or, if you
like, the checks and balances) is more
light-touch.
Cash-burning companies such as
4D Pharma are a particular risk. The
purpose of the stock market is to
enable them to raise capital, but until
their earnings are suﬃcient to gener-
ate free cash and proﬁts, it’s vital
for shareholders to know how much
funding will be needed, where it will
come from – and what the catches are.
There’s also the small matter of work-
ing out what the share price should
be. Putting a value on the pipeline of
drugs in development, Woodford said
in 2015, “involves making assump-
tions about issues that are very
challenging to model”. The process
“involves more art than science…”
Managing and investing in venture
capital requires diﬀerent skills than
those needed to run established busi-
nesses. 4D Pharma was too large for
a venture capital trust (VCT), but
VCT managers demonstrate the sort
of skills needed: they thoroughly
vet contender companies to ﬁnd any
holes in their apparently compel-
ling business cases. They then take
an equity stake in the few that pass,
and provide them with financial
focus with sound administration
support that enables the founders
to concentrate on the technical side
of the business.
Stranded shareholders in 4D
Pharma have expressed their frus-
tration through ShareSoc, which
champions and helps empower indi-
vidual investors, and is concerned
that despite directors’ legal obliga-
tions, they often avoid being held to
account. Some shareholders are nego-
tiating with lawyers about taking legal
action. They question the undue opti-
mism of the two founding 4D Pharma
directors, and say they were misled
with assurances about the “cash
runway”, the “catalysts” that failed
to materialise and the debt covenants,
which they say weren’t mentioned
when the Oxford funding was
announced in July 2021. Eight months
later, shareholders would have had to
hunt through the small print of the
2021 annual report or the US 20-F
ﬁling to ﬁnd them, and to read the
warning that “these circumstances
represent a material uncertainty as
to the group’s ability to continue as a
going concern”.
The board expressed conﬁdence
about raising more cash, but its
last-ditch attempts seem to have
been undermined by short-sell-
ing in the US. Some shareholders
are critical of the costly listing on
Nasdaq. Not much stock was traded
there and little if any further capi-
tal was raised. They say that the
group was spread too thinly. It had
a complex web of subsidiary compa-
nies, some of which, such as the
one in Aberdeen that employed 30
researchers, initially escaped admin-
istration. How much of the compa-
ny’s intellectual property, which
shareholders say included around
2,000 patents concerning gut bacte-
ria and their medical uses, has been
protected from creditors?
Part of the problem has been a lack
of communication since the compa-
ny’s shares were suspended. Maybe
everyone’s focus was on saving the
group, but shareholders could have
been kept better informed. It is
estimated that the administrator
Interpath has extracted something
like £4mn. Is there a structural prob-
lem here? The prime responsibility
of administrators is to the creditors.
What about the shareholders?
Maybe the villains of the piece
are the debt holders, who are given
so much power by UK insolvency
laws that predatory ones can exploit
distressed companies. 4D Pharma was
quoted in the US, where Chapter 11
enables a company’s business, debts
and assets to be reorganised in a way
not possible in the UK – but this was
a British company and UK insolvency
laws applied. ShareSoc would like to
see these laws reformed.
This is where it gets political, for
there’s a general frustration about
the Financial Conduct Authority,
which is supposed to regulate ﬁnan-
cial markets. Its limited resources
have led to criticisms about its eﬀec-
tiveness, citing a lack of enforcement
and a failure to act. Meanwhile, a
self-styled “world-leading” company
from Leeds with a pipeline of prom-
ising products and a relatively small
debt has been allowed to collapse into
foreign ownership. The government
failed to intervene, despite its prom-
ises of a Northern powerhouse and
the renewal of its pledges made in
June 2021 (and several times before)
about making the UK a science and
technology superpower.
4D Pharma is one of many to
have fallen into foreign hands. It
was one of nine biotech compa-
nies that ﬂoated in London in 2014,
encouraged by the stable pre-Brexit
government, low interest rates and
tax breaks. Another was gene-edit-
ing group Horizon Discovery. It was
acquired by US group PerkinElmer
Inc (US:PKI) in November 2020.
After the collapse of Woodford’s
fund, its stake in 4D Pharma was sold
oﬀwith a bundle of other biotech
investments to a Nasdaq-listed
patent licensing specialist backed
by a US activist investor.
Some might question whether Aim
companies are worth investing in.
The rationale is that most are small
companies that fall below the radar of
institutional fund managers. Bargains
can be found, although events rarely
turn out quite as expected. The larg-
est of the 2014 cohort was Circassia,
which ﬂoated as a pharmaceutical
company. After a series of setbacks
and losses, it eventually found proﬁts
selling medical devices under a new
name: Niox Group (NIOX).
It’s all about anticipating the risks.
Some early-stage companies will
provide jam tomorrow. For others,
as with 4D Pharma, tomorrow will
never come.
