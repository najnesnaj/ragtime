Bootconfig
----------

there is a 
- SAS controller
- SATA controller (cdrom)

the controllor has a bootorder as well !!!!
In order to boot from sata, the sata controller has to boot first!!!


**this is the way to boot an expensive hp server from a simple 2,5 inch sata disk (laptop 5V) ,using the onboard slimline cd-rom connector
