NFS Host and Client Setup in Proxmox
====================================

This guide will explain how to set up an NFS (Network File Sharing) server and add it as a remote storage in Proxmox.

1. **Install NFS Server**

   First, log in to the LXC container or the machine where the NFS server will be hosted. Then update the package list and install NFS:

   .. code-block:: bash

       apt-get update
       apt-get install sudo -y
       sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server

   Once installed, create a shared folder:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo mkdir /home/sharedfolder
       sudo chmod 777 /home/sharedfolder

   Next, edit the ``/etc/exports`` file to configure the shared directory for export:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo nano /etc/exports

   Add the following line (adjust the IP address and folder accordingly):

   .. code-block:: bash

       /home/sharedfolder 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

   Save the file and restart the NFS server:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo exportfs -ra
       sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

2. **Configure NFS Storage in Proxmox**

   Now log into your Proxmox host (the machine that will receive the NFS storage) and navigate to:

   *Datacenter > Storage > Add > NFS*

   .. image:: images/firefox_7FrqsKGmm4.png

   Here, enter the NFS server's IP address and select the shared directory.

   .. image:: images/firefox_85gotgwjhw.png

   Choose the desired contents for the storage (ISO images, containers, backups, etc.) and click *Add*.

3. **Set Permissions on LXC Container (If Applicable)**

   If the NFS share will be used in an LXC container, ensure that permissions for NFS usage are set correctly:

   .. image:: images/firefox_1mRMoEMAtl.png

   Check the *NFS* box under *Options* for the LXC container.

That's it! You have successfully set up an NFS server and added it to Proxmox as remote storage.
