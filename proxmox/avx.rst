AVX

I ran into a problem using lancedb container that needs avx2.
turns out that my old hp dl380p g8 with xeon e5-2650 v2 does not have AVX2....



AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) and AVX2 are sets of CPU instructions designed to improve performance for tasks that involve heavy mathematical computations, like simulations, scientific calculations, or multimedia processing.

    AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions):
        Introduced with Intel's Sandy Bridge processors (2011).
        Supports 256-bit wide vector operations, allowing for parallel processing of multiple data points in a single instruction. This improves performance in applications like video processing, scientific simulations, and cryptographic tasks.

    AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2):
        Introduced with Intel's Haswell processors (2013).
        Expands on AVX by supporting more operations and improving the handling of integer operations. AVX2 also increases the vector size to 256 bits for integer data and introduces FMA (Fused Multiply-Add), which further boosts performance in floating-point operations.

Can the Xeon E5-2650 v2 Support AVX2?

No, the Intel Xeon E5-2650 v2 does not support AVX2. This processor, part of the Ivy Bridge-EP family, supports AVX but not AVX2, as AVX2 was introduced with the later Haswell architecture.

what do they mean : To resolve the issue all I had to do was update the docker run command with the lancedb_revert tag,
