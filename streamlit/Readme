Explanation

    Convert PDF to Text: Extracts text from each page in the uploaded PDF and stores it in st.session_state so other actions can use it.
    Correct Text: Uppercases the converted text as a placeholder correction function. This action also requires the "Convert to Text" action to be performed first.
    Split Text: Displays the first 10 lines of the converted text as a demonstration of splitting. You can adjust num_lines as needed.
